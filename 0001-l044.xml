 <t id="30211000">(* Argon Vs Holy Order War Missions *)</t>
 <t id="30211001">Ah, very good.</t>
 <t id="30211002">It's my job to coordinate our efforts against the Holy Order, not only with the Argon Navy but also volunteer freelance pilots, such as yourself.</t>
 <t id="30211003">If you're here, you must have been recognised as a true friend of the Argon Federation.</t>
 <t id="30211004">If you're here, you must have been recognised as an outstanding citizen of the Argon Federation.</t>
 <t id="30211005">The Federation is in great need for pilots like you.</t>
 <t id="30211006">While we are always under constant threat of Xenon incursions, the Holy Order situation itself has become a challenging and complex conflict.</t>
 <t id="30211007">As such, we will require any potential recruits to undergo a probation period.</t>
 <t id="30211008">And no, it isn't because you're a Paranid yourself.</t>
 <t id="30211009">The last thing we need is some screw-up turning each and every Paranid against us because they fired on a Godrealm ship by mistake. You don't strike me as a screw-up, so why don't we get started?</t>
 <t id="30211010">Any questions?</t>
 <t id="30211011">There will be a wide range of tasks, from combat deployments to construction work. Depending on the situation, you will have a selection of tasks to choose from.</t>
 <t id="30211012">You will be paid as you complete your allotted tasks, with a potential bonus at the end.</t>
 <t id="30211013">As a Paranid, I expect you know the nuances better than us, but I'll give our take on it.</t>
 <t id="30211014">It's essentially a Paranid civil war. While the Gates were shut down, several Paranid factions found themselves without their leader, the Pontifex Maximus. So, what do you do when you have no leadership? You panic and hatch a new one.</t>
 <t id="30211015">That worked fine until the Gates re-connected and each faction pushed their own Pontifex as the one true king. Now, there are only two Pontifices left; that we know of. The one of the Godrealm and the one of the Holy Order.</t>
 <t id="30211016">It's true that the Federation and the Godrealm haven't always seen eye to eye, but we're on friendly terms right now.</t>
 <t id="30211017">That rubs the Holy Order the wrong way, primarily because they appear to be considerably more xenophobic. And given how they oppose the Godrealm as a whole, they like to highlight our current relations as a weakness.</t>
 <t id="30211018">Along with the Antigone Republic, we've managed to drive off the majority of their pushes into our space.</t>
 <t id="30211019">Anything else?</t>
 <t id="30211020">Alright. I'll have a suitable task picked out for you momentarily.</t>
 <t id="30211021">Stay safe out there, pilot.</t>
 <t id="30211022">Yes, I saw. Very good.</t>
 <t id="30211023">You will now find tasks related to the Holy Order conflict in your mission interface.</t>
 <t id="30211024">Here are the current tasks.</t>
 <t id="30211025">There are currently no open tasks.</t>
 <t id="30211026">Sorry, but that is a very sensitive situation. We require pilots who have proven themselves to the Argon Federation.</t>
 <t id="30211027">Sorry. We're still reviewing your performance from the last time.</t>
 <t id="30211028">This is a joint mission with the God Realm of the Paranid, so please bring your best.</t>
 <t id="30211050">Unfortunately, your current standing with us does not allow you to take part in our operations.</t>
 <t id="30211051">Your performance during your assignments is frankly below the standards we set for pilots of the Argon Navy.</t>
 <t id="30211052">You are welcome to re-apply later, should you get the chance.</t>
 <t id="30211053">(greeting)Oh, you again?</t>

 <t id="99901">The Jump Gate shutdown is now defined as the single most important event in the history of the network. A disaster of cataclysmic proportion that changed everything, redefining our very way of life. Despite all of the odds, however, we have come through the other side, and along the way have found more to research and explore than ever before. That is the area in which we pride ourselves. The Alliance of the Word. Founded on the idea that those disconnected from the Jump Gate network could be saved, we strive to find out more, for the good of all of us.</t>
 <t id="99902">This is where you come in, pilot. You are are member of our team of explorers now, and we're depending on you to find out whatever you can about this strange, new Jump Gate network; its mysteries, its secrets. Good luck, pilot.</t>

 <t id="30210000">(* Argon Vs Xenon War Missions *)</t>
 <t id="30210001">Ah, nice to meet you.</t>
 <t id="30210002">My job here is to help coordinate our efforts against the Xenon and given the threat, we're in need of as many volunteers as we can get.</t>
 <t id="30210003">If you're here, it means you have been recognised as a true friend of the Argon Federation.</t>
 <t id="30210004">If you're here, it means you have been recognised as an outstanding citizen of the Argon Federation.</t>
 <t id="30210005">There is a great need for pilots like you.</t>
 <t id="30210006">The Xenon have been a constant threat throughout our history. Many see them as a force of nature, something we have to weather and survive, but the reality is, this is a war.</t>
 <t id="30210007">We can't just throw every passing pilot at the enemy. Any potential recruits will undergo a probation period.</t>
 <t id="30210008">Looking at your records, I see you consider yourself a 'Xenon Slayer'. Good for you, but that won't help you cut corners.</t>
 <t id="30210009">Each engagement needs to be a victory or they'll overrun us. I'm sure you knew that or you wouldn't be here. Let's get started.</t>
 <t id="30210010">Any questions?</t>
 <t id="30210011">There will be a wide range of tasks, from combat deployments to construction work. Depending on the situation, you will have a selection of tasks to choose from.</t>
 <t id="30210012">You will be paid as you complete your allotted tasks, with a potential bonus at the end.</t>
 <t id="30210013">As someone who's been toe to toe with the Xenon I'm sure you know what they are capable of.</t>
 <t id="30210014">The Xenon are a 'race' of intelligent, replicating machines and they have been a looming threat throughout our history.</t>
 <t id="30210015">They were originally created to help the Terrans explore the stars and terraform worlds but trying to control Artificial General Intelligence proved costly.</t>
 <t id="30210016">And now, hundreds of years later, we're still trying to clean up their mistake but we have no idea how far they have spread throughout the universe.</t>
 <t id="30210017">All we can do is hold out and prevent them from spreading any further. Every other government, allied or not, is faced with the Xenon threat. It's about the only thing we can all agree on.</t>
 <t id="30210018">We've even had temporary ceasefires with the Holy Order when faced with a Xenon attack. Quite temporary though.</t>
 <t id="30210019">Anything else?</t>
 <t id="30210020">Alright. I'll have a suitable task picked out for you momentarily.</t>
 <t id="30210021">Stay safe out there, pilot.</t>
 <t id="30210022">Yes, I saw. Good work.</t>
 <t id="30210023">You will now find tasks related to the Xenon in your mission interface.</t>
 <t id="30210024">Here are the current tasks.</t>
 <t id="30210025">There are currently no open tasks.</t>
 <t id="30210026">Sorry, but this is a high-risk situation. We require pilots who have proven themselves to the Argon Federation.</t>
 <t id="30210027">Sorry. We're still reviewing your performance from the last time.</t>
 <t id="30210028">This is a joint mission with the a number of allies, so please bring your best.</t>
 <t id="30210050">Unfortunately, your current standing with us does not allow you to take part in our operations.</t>
 <t id="30210051">Your performance during your last assignment was frankly below the standards we set for pilots of the Argon Navy.</t>
 <t id="30210052">You are welcome to re-apply later, should you get the chance.</t>
 <t id="30210053">(greeting)Oh, you again?</t>
 <t id="30210070">This is a call from the Argon Federation to all willing and able pilots to aid us in defending our space from the Xenon.</t>
 <t id="30210071">This is going to be a major operation, so check your fire, and keep a level head.</t>

 <t id="30210079">(briefing status - pessimistic)Our recent efforts against the Xenon have suffered due to our conflict with the Holy Order.</t>
 <t id="30210080">(briefing status - pessimistic)We are currently on the back-foot in regards to the Xenon.</t>
 <t id="30210081">(briefing status - pessimistic)The Xenon are pushing against us and are making up ground. We're reevaluating our position.</t>
 <t id="30210082">(briefing status - pessimistic)We've lost serious ground to the Xenon recently. We are considering alternative strategies.</t>

 <t id="30201001">...I seem to be broadcasting... Can nobody hear this? Hello? Hmm, maybe if I... Yes, that should be better. Hello, anyone?</t>
 <t id="30201002">I'm in a rather unfortunate situation. Is anyone able to help me? My work is quite time-critical, so if you can, please contact me soon.</t>
 <t id="30201003">Ah, that should do it. I had to disable my voice filter. I was beginning to think my messages were being intercepted by those Split fellows. I'm a little disappointed that it was this easy.</t>
 <t id="30201004">I don't suppose they sent you did they? Oh, that would be quite devious.</t>
 <t id="30201005">Hmm, have we met before?</t>
 <t id="30201006">Hmm, what should I call them. I suppose captors is quite apt. Employers? They let me work on my own projects some days you see.</t>
 <t id="30201007">Ah, yes. You see, I'm in a spot of bother. I am in the middle of some important scientific research which I'm unable to pursue personally from my current location. I'm looking for an assistant to aid me.</t>
 <t id="30201008">I see. I expected a more positive response to a mysterious distress call with mention of science. Hmm, perhaps I'll describe it as 'exciting' or 'stimulating' next time for a better outcome. Oh, you're still there? Thank you for your time.</t>
 <t id="30201009">I'll send the task to your ship computer. This is rather exciting!</t>
 <t id="30201010">Wonderful! I have managed to place the device on a nearby docking area. You should be getting the coordinates now.</t>
 <t id="30201011">Very good. I see you have found the device. This will allow me to monitor your activity and perform experiments remotely. Please keep it safe.</t>
 <t id="30201012">Oh my. It seems that your pulse is elevated. You must be very excited to take part in this expedition. I'm glad!</t>
 <t id="30201013">I do wonder how my homeworld is faring. It has been such a long time since we have heard news of it.</t>
 <t id="30201014">Should we ever get to meet face to face, I do hope that you can bring me some fresh BoFu. The nuggets the Split give me are more stale than their humour.</t>
 <t id="30201015">Is that BoFu? You remembered! My friend, this makes me so happy!</t>
 <t id="30201016">So, shall we begin? I will attempt to direct you in the best way possible. Please be patient with me.</t>
 <t id="30201020">I don't expect you've spoken to too many Boron before. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Boso Ta and it is a pleasure. I do wish it were in person but my current situation is quite precarious.</t>
 <t id="30201021">You must be very curious on what a old lonely Boron is trying to achieve. There are still so many mysteries and unanswered questions. Are Spaceflies sentient? Where are the lost Boron systems? Is faster than light telepathy possible?</t>
 <t id="30201022">It is our task to push the physics of this universe to the breaking point and see if it answers any of those questions! My current employers only seem happy when my research results in novel weapon modifications. Very curious people, those Split.</t>
 <t id="30201023">I do hope they move me to a new tank soon. My tentacles grow weak.</t>
 <t id="30201024">You appear to be getting close to where I detected an anomaly.</t>
 <t id="30201025">I've uploaded new software to your ship systems.</t>
 <t id="30201026">Could you please try using the Long-Range Scanner to search for an anomaly in this vicinity.(for LRS name see {20108,1001} )</t>
 <t id="30201027">Ahha! There it is. If reports are to be believed, these anomalies are tears which may lead to other areas of space, much like the Jump Gates.</t>
 <t id="30201028">So, how adventurous do you feel today? Thanks to my research, I do have a fair idea of where you may end up. Of course, the quickest way to confirm my theory is to put it into practice!</t>
 <t id="30201029">Can you hear me? It took a moment to realign the frequency. It is just as I thought. You have made it through the anomaly and emerged in a distant region.</t>
 <t id="30201030">Your location is actually of great interest to me. Over the years, I have managed to pull sensor logs from passing ships to help further my work. I highlighted this as a prime location for my research, should I ever get the chance.</t>
 <t id="30201031">I'm sorry to interrupt, but it seems that you have arrived at a rather curious location.</t>
 <t id="30201034">I suggest you mark the location of the anomaly on your map.</t>
 <t id="30201035">Oh, it appears you have found another anomaly! How interesting.</t>
 <t id="30201036">Are you having trouble locating the anomaly in the area I have stated? I suggest you use the Long-Range scanner to help find it.</t>
 <t id="30201037">(having trouble getting through the anomaly)Hmm, it does seem quite tricky getting through the anomaly. It appears to require some speed to punch through.</t>
 <t id="30201038">(having trouble getting through the anomaly - joke)It looks like you're trying to enter an anomaly. Would you like help with that?</t>
 <t id="30201039">I don't mean to distract you from your business but do you intend to investigate that anomaly further? My tentacles are tingling in anticipation of the science we will achieve!</t>
 <t id="30201040">While the previous anomaly is interesting, my findings point to something else here which I expect will lead to a ground-breaking discovery. Allow me to guide you to a particular area.</t>
 <t id="30201041">I am currently evaluating what equipment we will need to make the most of this location.</t>
 <t id="30201042">Space here is wounded, with a scar in its fabric which seems to have healed multiple times. There is no record of any abnormal activity at these sites. To everyone else, this is simply an empty area of space.</t>
 <t id="30201043">In my search for signals from long-lost Boron I have detected multiple scars in space which continue to spew a multitude of particles and radiation. In a bustling sector such as this, it would only be seen as background noise. However, some of the noise seems to have artificial form.</t>
 <t id="30201044">We are going to tear this scar wide open and peer inside! Of course, the universe is a fickle thing. One miscalculation and we may well destroy this whole system. Ha! Such stakes make this all the more exciting!</t>
 <t id="30201045">Before we get started, allow me to reimburse you for your help so far. I do hope the Split don't mind me using their credit account to help fund our venture.</t>
 <t id="30201046">Now, the experiment. You will first need to place a satellite around this area in order for us to better understand its nature and how to best provoke the invisible anomaly.</t>
 <t id="30201047">I suggest you also deploy a resource probe so that we can see how the anomaly has affected the local environment. You should be able to acquire these deployable items from stations which offer upgrades.</t>
 <t id="30201048">I know of such a station near your location. I will add the information to your map.</t>
 <t id="30201049">It has been a great many years since I've had such a feeling of freedom. While the Split moved me to several locations as a part of my work, nothing quite beats going on a scientific expedition.</t>
 <t id="30201050">The placement must be precise.</t>
 <t id="30201051">Hmm, no. That satellite is not placed in a favorable position. You can collect it and redeploy if you wish.</t>
 <t id="30201052">Ah, good work. I am receiving a much clearer signal from the tear. Almost immediately, I can see that there are far more gravimetric shears here compared to any other anomaly ever documented. That indicates mass, but of what?</t>
 <t id="30201053">This shows some similarities with a Jump Gate event horizon but there is something else. Could it be a temporal distortion? Perhaps dimensional? Very interesting.</t>
 <t id="30201054">Would you please deploy a resource probe in the specified area, I am curious of this environment.</t>
 <t id="30201055">I see that you have already placed the resource probe in a suitable location. Very good.</t>
 <t id="30201056">You will now be able to see the yields of the resources in the area, should you wish to extract them. As for our research, it seems that nearby objects are covered in exotic particles, possibly spewed from the anomaly.</t>
 <t id="30201057">I hate to be a bother, but I have an idea on how to proceed.</t>
 <t id="30201067">We will need a ship to be flown to a very precise location, near the anomaly. If we fit the ship with the right equipment, we may be able to open the tear wider and have a better idea of what is on the other side.</t>
 <t id="30201068">This will likely end up in the ship's destruction so I will help cover the expense of acquiring a new ship for the task.</t>
 <t id="30201069">Be sure that the ship is evacuated. It's far too early in this experiment for needless casualties.</t>
 <t id="30201070">The ship is in the correct position but is missing some of the required equipment. Please take a look at the details I have provided.</t>
 <t id="30201071">Very good. We seem to be ready for the initial test. I would advise that you clear the area as there are a number of unknowns.</t>
 <t id="30201072">The area must be clear of any obstacles!</t>
 <t id="30201073">(something goes wrong)Well then... I suppose we will have to try again.</t>
 <t id="30201074">I have successfully interfaced with the ship. I am increasing the output of the power-plant while reducing the shielding of the antimatter containers to see if that affects the anomaly.</t>
 <t id="30201075">Wonderful, we are getting a reaction! The ship is beginning to show strain but I will continue to push it further. Keep your distance.</t>
 <t id="30201076">The tear is expanding, it is about to reach the ship! The antimatter will most likely detonate!</t>
 <t id="30201077">Please check your mission briefing for the equipment the ship will need for the experiment.</t>
 <t id="30201090">What is this? Some large artificial structure? So, this is what was on the other side of the tear? It does seem that our investigation has lead to some potentially ground-breaking discovery!</t>
 <t id="30201091">Now my friend, this is where we must proceed with both haste and caution. While I admit, tearing through space-time with an antimatter explosion was far from restrained, we now have something in front of us of untold scientific value. We would be fools to continue carelessly.</t>
 <t id="30201092">For the benefit of the universe, let us hurry and claim our prize before someone can beat us to it! I'll be damned if some passing Teladi junk dealer decides to break it down for spare parts. Or worse yet, the Ministry of Finance Science Division.</t>
 <t id="30201093">I will begin to interface with the structure remotely. Do you mind flying around it so I can make some additional readings.</t>
 <t id="30201094">Let's start over here.</t>
 <t id="30201095">I'm marking a location of particular interest.</t>
 <t id="30201096">And now here.</t>
 <t id="30201097">These markings are not quite as 'alien' as I would have expected from such an object. Could this be a top-secret installation? Oh my. I do hope we haven't hijacked some distant Terran station.</t>
 <t id="30201098">It does seem somewhat unfinished, and the materials it is constructed from are quite strange. Even the computer pathways I am navigating are unconventional.</t>
 <t id="30201099">I cannot yet ascertain the function of this asteroid like mass in regards to the rest of the station. Given these readings, it may well be a power source. How interesting.</t>
 <t id="30201100">Ah, progress. It seems that this station is in an emergency state, possibly due to our actions. However, it appears that there is a backdoor protocol to resolve this. Give me a moment.</t>
 <t id="30201101">Wonderful! You see? The station is now under our control. I have access to much of its systems, although some are so alien I will need to take time to investigate them.</t>
 <t id="30201102">There appear to be connection points for additional station modules and they do seem to conform to our standards. If we wish to physically interface with the station without damaging it, I suggest constructing an area to land.</t>
 <t id="30201103">Oh, it appears I must go. My Split employers are approaching and they sound agitated.</t>
 <t id="30201104">I will be in touch when I am able. As I have said, see if you are able to merge their technology with our own by building a dock.</t>
 <t id="30201105">Take care my friend.</t>
 <t id="30201117">(player under attack)Oh. You seem to be having some issues. I'll call back later.</t>
 <t id="30201118">Have you heard the Split legends regarding the 'Space Duck' of Namek? A creature so majestic it brings even the Split to tears. I heard my captors speaking of it in passing.</t>
 <t id="30201120">(plot as in plot of land)Allow me to cover the cost of the plot licence.</t>
 <t id="30201121">Well done! I have been watching your progress with much interest.</t>
 <t id="30201122">When you dock see if you can access any of the internal structure from an elevator.</t>
 <t id="30201123">Hmm, no. It appears we are still locked out from direct access.</t>
 <t id="30201124">It seems I have no choice. I must leave my current location and join you on that station.</t>
 <t id="30201125">I didn't expect I would need to enact this escape plan so abruptly.</t>
 <t id="30201126">Your help would be greatly appreciated. I will send instructions.</t>
 <t id="30201127">A fast combat ship is preferable.</t>
 <t id="30201128">I must admit, I am beginning to feel a bit tense. I do hope this goes to plan.</t>
 <t id="30201129">I have further refined the plan. Please take a look.</t>
 <t id="30201130">As you can see, I wish to escape the station via a chartered freighter.</t>
 <t id="30201131">There are actually multiple ships involved as to confound anyone wishing to track me.</t>
 <t id="30201132">I would like you to protect any ship which should get into trouble.</t>
 <t id="30201133">Please wait for the ship to conclude its 'business'. It will launch shortly.</t>
 <t id="30201134">Please protect this ship from any harm. While it is a decoy, I would rather no harm comes to the crew.</t>
 <t id="30201135">I am successfully aboard my transport and en-route to the installation.</t>
 <t id="30201136">Oh, that didn't take long at all. It seems that my disappearance has been noticed.</t>
 <t id="30201137">I expect my ship is at a safe distance. I can't say the same for the others. Please be alert.</t>
 <t id="30201138">I am successfully docked. I will begin my work.</t>
 <t id="30201139">My, this structure is far more impressive in person than I expected.</t>
 <t id="30201140">Once the ships are safe, please join me.</t>
 <t id="30201141">Good work.</t>
 <t id="30201142">Oh. That is rather unfortunate.</t>
 <t id="30201143">When you land, enter the elevator.</t>
 <t id="30201144">Aha! At last, we meet face to face!</t>
 <t id="30201145">This installation is equipped for habitation of all races and this room seems to be some sort of research area.</t>
 <t id="30201146">I expect I could spend years pouring over the data contained in these systems.</t>
 <t id="30201147">I believe we will need help to run this station effectively. You could look to employ a manager.</t>
 <t id="30201148">Come see me when you have a moment. I have made some progress.</t>
 <t id="30201149">Yes, I already have made some progress.</t>
 <t id="30201150">There appears to be several things we can research at this facility.</t>
 <t id="30201151">Please take a look.</t>
 <t id="30201152">As you can see, there is much to do.</t>
 <t id="30201153">I personally find mention of this 'Teleportation' irresistible but I leave it to you to decide what we research first.</t>
 <t id="30201154">Please note that these research items have certain requirements.</t>
 <t id="30201160">If you could, please gather the required materials.</t>
 <t id="30201161">I will need some materials to get started.</t>
 <t id="30201162">There are certain requirements for me to start that research.</t>
 <t id="30201163">This research requires certain things to be fulfilled first.</t>
 <t id="30201164">This will allow you to gain blueprints by scanning leaks on certain modules.</t>
 <t id="30201165">This will allow you to craft standard equipment modifications.</t>
 <t id="30201166">This will allow you to construct much improved equipment modifications.</t>
 <t id="30201167">This will allow you to construct superior equipment modifications.</t>
 <t id="30201168">Good choice. I will begin right away.</t>
 <t id="30201169">Very good. I will let you know when I am done.</t>
 <t id="30201170">I look forward to seeing how this turns out.</t>
 <t id="30201171">I expect this will be revolutionary!</t>
 <t id="30201172">I have concluded the research.</t>
 <t id="30201173">I have come to the end of my research</t>
 <t id="30201174">I have concluded my research and the results are astounding.</t>
 <t id="30201175">The results of my research are far beyond my expectations.</t>
 <t id="30201180">It appears some Terran technology was being used to research teleportation over long distances.</t>
 <t id="30201181">I have finished the teleportation research.</t>
 <t id="30201182">I am yet to test it on a lifeform. Given that I am monitoring your lifesigns anyway, perhaps you could do the honours.</t>
 <t id="30201183">I believe I can improve the range of the teleporter with only a miniscule chance of complete cell collapse.</t>

 <t id="99901">We live in dark times. For centuries the Paranid lived in peace. Strife between us was a relic of the past. So dependent are we on the Pontifex that when the Jump Gates shut down and the Pontifex could not contact us, chaos ensued. Life fell into ruin. We searched desperately for guidance - some even going so far as to birth new leaders, each with their own perspective, each with their own ambitions. When the Jump Gates re-aligned, it could only end in conflict. Each Pontifex believed they were in the right; each unwilling to back down. Civil war was simply a matter of time.</t>
 <t id="99902">I am proud to serve in this fight, on the side proven to be just. Now a single faction remains that refuses to return to the Godrealm. It is my duty to protect our people from their heresy, and to destroy any that would threaten our way of life.</t>

 <t id="30212000">(* Paranid Vs Holy Order Missions *)</t>
 <t id="30212001">Ah, very good.</t>
 <t id="30212002">My responsibility is to coordinate our forces in our campaign against the heretics of the so-called 'Holy Order'. Pilots such as you have been encouraged to join our cause.</t>
 <t id="30212003">Your being here means that you have gained recognition as a worthy friend of the Paranid Empire.</t>
 <t id="30212004">Your being here means that you have gained recognition as a true champion of the Paranid Empire.</t>
 <t id="30212005">There will always be place for pilots who share our ideals.</t>
 <t id="30212006">This schism within the Paranid has humiliated us beyond measure. Our once proud race has been likened to that of squabbling infants, all because of ineptitude and cowardice.</t>
 <t id="30212007">Our foe are fellow Paranid, so any victory will not be easy. As such, we require you undergo a trial.</t>
 <t id="30212008">I am curious to see how you fare compared to my Paranid brethren.</t>
 <t id="30212009">Let us begin.</t>
 <t id="30212010">Do you have questions?</t>
 <t id="30212011">We will grant you the choice of tasks, from combat deployments to construction work. What is available will depend on the current situation in the area.</t>
 <t id="30212012">You will be paid as you complete your allocated tasks, and should we see fit, you will be further awarded.</t>
 <t id="30212013">It is rare for one such as yourself to be so interested in Paranid matters. I will indulge you.</t>
 <t id="30212014">Is it a rather deplorable situation. During the time of the deactivated Jump Gates, many Paranid found themselves cut off from our home systems.</t>
 <t id="30212015">Without the Pontifex Maximus to guide them, a number of factions took the action to hatch a replacement. It was a desperate act, but somewhat understandable.</t>
 <t id="30212016">However, on reconnecting with us, several factions refused to submit to the true Pontifex leading us to strike them down.</t>
 <t id="30212017">And now, only the heretics of the 'Holy Order' remain. Even when shunned by many, they still find the means to wage a war against us.</t>
 <t id="30212018">Should they concede and put their capabilities to use in the Empire, we would find ourselves unmatched.</t>
 <t id="30212019">Shall we begin?</t>
 <t id="30212020">I will select a suitable task for you momentarily.</t>
 <t id="30212021">I look forward to your return.</t>
 <t id="30212022">I was observing. Very good.</t>
 <t id="30212023">You will now find tasks related to our conflict with the Order in your mission interface.</t>
 <t id="30212024">Here are the current tasks.</t>
 <t id="30212025">There are currently no open tasks.</t>
 <t id="30212026">We will not simply have anyone interfere in our matters. Do not bother us unless you have proven yourself worth our time.</t>
 <t id="30212027">We are still passing judgement on your previous performance. Leave us.</t>
 <t id="30212028">Do not bring us shame with a poor performance.</t>
 <t id="30212050">We do not currently deem you worthy of aiding us in our cause.</t>
 <t id="30212051">Your performance during your last assignment was far below our standards. Begone.</t>
 <t id="30212052">Should you improve yourself, you may yet get a chance to aid us.</t>
 <t id="30212053">(greeting)Again you come?</t>
 <t id="30212070">The mighty Paranid Empire calls for skilled pilots to join us in crushing the heretics.</t>
 <t id="30212071">Those wishing to join must be unyielding in their ideals and willing to fight for the one true Pontifex.</t>
 <t id="30212072">Our goals remain to repel any heretic aggression and quash their rebellion. If you believe yourself worthy, join us.</t>

 <t id="30212082">(briefing status - pessimistic)We have lost some ground to the Order but it will not change the outcome of this conflict.</t>
 <t id="30212083">(briefing status - pessimistic)The Order has found the zeal to give us pause but we will soon retaliate.</t>

 <t id="30213007">The Argon are foes which are particularly troublesome. We will not risk low-skilled rabble jeopardising our operations, so we require you undergo a trial.</t>
 <t id="30213008">Of course, with you being Argon yourself, we will hold you under much scrutiny.</t>
 <t id="30213009">Shall we begin?</t>
 <t id="30213010">Do you require answers?</t>
 <t id="30213011">We will grant you the choice of tasks, from combat deployments to construction work. What is available will depending on the current situation in the area.</t>
 <t id="30213012">You will be paid as you complete your allocated tasks, and should we see fit, you will be further awarded.</t>
 <t id="30213013">If you expect me to divulge sensitive information, you are quite mistaken. However, I will humour you.</t>
 <t id="30213014">The Paranid Empire has had a history of conflict with the Argon, and now it has fallen to us to stem their expansion towards our space.</t>
 <t id="30213015">I am sure that many have described this conflict as blind xenophobia on our part, but that is far from the case. While we deem them lesser beings, we are not opposed to coexistance.</t>
 <t id="30213016">However, they choose to side with the Godrealm as well as ignore our warnings on encroaching on our space. We will do what we must to protect our interests.</t>
 <t id="30213017">I expect a number within our ranks do wish for their eradication but I am far more benevolent. A crushing defeat will do.</t>
 <t id="30213018">I do hope they will give us battles worthy of mention in the annals of Paranid history.</t>
 <t id="30213019">Are you satisfied?</t>
 <t id="30213020">I will select a suitable task for you momentarily.</t>
 <t id="30213021">I look forward to your return.</t>
 <t id="30213022">I was observing. Very good.</t>
 <t id="30213023">You will now find tasks related to our conflict with the Argon in your mission interface.</t>
 <t id="30213024">Here are the current tasks.</t>
 <t id="30213025">There are currently no open tasks.</t>
 <t id="30213026">We will not simply have anyone interfere in Holy Order matters. Do not bother us unless you have proven yourself worthy.</t>
 <t id="30213027">We are still passing judgement on your previous performance. Begone.</t>
 <t id="30213028">Do not forget that you are representing our glorious order. Do not bring us shame.</t>
 <t id="30213050">We do not currently deem you worthy of aiding us in our cause.</t>
 <t id="30213051">Your performance during your last assignment was far below our standards. Leave me be.</t>
 <t id="30213052">Should you improve yourself, you may yet get a chance to aid us.</t>
 <t id="30213053">(greeting)Again you seek my guidance?</t>
 <t id="30213070">The glorious Holy Order calls for skilful pilots to join us in defending our space from the Argon Federation.</t>
 <t id="30213071">This is not a trivial matter. Those wishing to join must be righteous and relentlessly loyal.</t>
 <t id="30213072">Our goals remain to hold our space from Argon aggression and quash their ability to wage their little war against us. If you are worthy, join us.</t>
 <t id="30213073">(briefing status - optimistic)Our recent efforts against the Argon Federation are going well, as we expected.</t>

 <t id="30213079">(briefing status - pessimistic)Through underhanded means, the Argon have scored some victories against us.</t>
 <t id="30213080">(briefing status - pessimistic)Our enemy does on occasion display some intelligence capable of giving us pause.</t>
 <t id="30213081">(briefing status - pessimistic)We believe the Argon are being aided by the Godrealm, explaining their gains.</t>
 <t id="30213082">(briefing status - pessimistic)We have lost some ground to the Argon but it will not change the outcome of this war.</t>
 <t id="30213083">(briefing status - pessimistic)The Argon have taken advantage of our hubris but we will strike when they overextend.</t>

 <t id="30214001">Hmm, I see.</t>
 <t id="30214002">My position among the Holy Order gives me authority to judge and enact our military strategies against the pitiful wretches of the Godrealm. I also shall pass judgement upon you.</t>
 <t id="30214003">Your being here means that you have gained recognition as a worthy friend of the Holy Order.</t>
 <t id="30214004">Your being here means that you have gained recognition as a true champion of the Holy Order.</t>
 <t id="30214005">There will always be place for pilots willing to represent our cause.</t>
 <t id="30214006">This conflict is one the likes of which the cosmos has never seen. Only fellow Paranid can stand against us so.</t>
 <t id="30214007">Because of this, we will not risk any passing pilot tarnishing our path to victory. You must undergo a trial.</t>
 <t id="30214008">And yes, we are accommodating enough to give lesser races the opportunity to aid us.</t>
 <t id="30214009">I have much to do so I propose that we begin.</t>
 <t id="30214010">Do you require answers?</t>
 <t id="30214011">You will be granted the choice of many tasks, from combat deployments to construction work. What is available will depend on the current situation in the area.</t>
 <t id="30214012">You will be paid as you complete your allotted tasks, and we may see fit to reward you further at the conclusion.</t>
 <t id="30214013">It is rare for one such as yourself to be so interested in Paranid matters. Rarer still for us to indulge. Very well.</t>
 <t id="30214014">It is a shameful story. Our once proud Paranid race has been humiliated before all of the lesser races. A 'civil-war' they call it.</t>
 <t id="30214015">The 'Godrealm' believe themselves bathed in holy light when they are in-fact blinded by it. They can not fathom that their false Pontifex has been surpassed; a natural reaction I suppose.</t>
 <t id="30214016">Unfortunately, we must do what we can to silence those who speak against the true Pontifex, even if they were once brethren. They will abandon their ways and join us or they will be cast aside.</t>
 <t id="30214017">And let us not forget the damnable Argon, those whom our fellow Paranid have run to for aid.</t>
 <t id="30214018">'Tis no matter. Our cause is just and our strength is unmatched.</t>
 <t id="30214019">Are we done here?</t>
 <t id="30214020">Very well. I will select a suitable task for you momentarily.</t>
 <t id="30214021">I trust you will not disappoint us.</t>

 <t id="30214028">Do not forget that you are representing our glorious order. Do not bring us shame.</t>
 <t id="30214050">We do not currently deem you worthy of aiding us in our cause.</t>
 <t id="30214051">Your performance during your last assignment was pitiful. I do not believe we need to discuss this any further.</t>

 <t id="30214081">(briefing status - pessimistic)The Goldreamn continues to push us, backed by a number of lesser species. A revolting turn.</t>
 <t id="30214082">(briefing status - pessimistic)While we have lost ground to the Godrealm, we expect our alternative strategies shall soon confound them.</t>
 <t id="30214083">(briefing status - pessimistic)It seems we have given the Godrealm opportunity to expand their forces. It will not last.</t>

 <t id="101">System</t>
 <t id="102">A System represents a vast area of space, typically a single solar system. Systems, sometimes known as 'clusters' contain smaller areas called Sectors. Sectors are joined within a System by Superhighways while travel between their containing Systems is via Jump Gates.</t>
 <t id="103">Systems</t>
 <t id="201">Sector</t>
 <t id="202">Sectors are large areas of interest within a single System. They contain smaller areas of interest called Zones which are all connected within the Sector by Local Highways. The containing Sectors are connected by Superhighways.</t>
 <t id="203">Sectors</t>
 <t id="301">Zone</t>
 <t id="302">Zones are points of interest within a single Sector. Zones are connected through the Local Highway system but not all Zones are directly connected by the same Local Highway to all other Zones in the same Sector.</t>
 <t id="303">Zones</t>
 <t id="401">Highway</t>
 <t id="402">Highways were first created by JSDD before the shut down of the Jump Gates. Their purpose is to allow bearable travel times through and between Sectors.</t>
 <t id="403">Highways</t>
 <t id="501">Local Highway</t>
 <t id="502">Local Highways are unidirectional paths of accelerated traffic used to connect areas of interest, called Zones, within a Sector and reduce travel time. As they operate at lower speeds than the Superhighways, it is fairly safe to enter or leave the Local Highway at any time. Local Highways have opened up fast and convenient mass-traffic and trading lanes between and within Zones.</t>
 <t id="503">Local Highways</t>
 <t id="601">Superhighway</t>
 <t id="602">Superhighways connect Sectors within the same System. They operate at highly accelerated speeds so leaving them during transit is not possible. They have opened up inter-sector travel to commercial mass-traffic without the need for stasis chambers or unwanted aging effects on travellers.</t>
 <t id="603">Superhighways</t>
 <t id="701">Jump Gate</t>
 <t id="702">The mysterious Jump Gates were supposedly created by a race which most species refer to as the Ancients. These devices are apparently spread throughout the entire galaxy and possibly beyond. They provide the only feasible and effective method of travel between Systems at this time. Unfortunately, most if not all became non-operational at the event known as the Jump Gate shutdown.</t>
 <t id="703">Jump Gates</t>
 <t id="704">Inactive Jump Gate</t>
 <t id="801">Asteroid</t>
 <t id="802">Usually the remnants from astronomical body formation or the result of collisions and meteor strikes, asteroids of all sorts of sizes provide sources of several recoverable minerals and crystals. Whilst many asteroids only contain basic common ores and minerals, others may be the source of rarer and far more profitable materials. A space miner's life is usually fairly monotonous, but there can be moments of excitement and elation.</t>
 <t id="803">Asteroids</t>
 <t id="901">Galaxy</t>
 <t id="902">The Galaxy, when used to refer to the local Galaxy or 'the Known Galaxy', is a loose term for the collection of Systems currently considered as surveyed and mapped by the known sentient life-forms. Intergalactic travel is not currently thought possible by any known life-form.</t>
 <t id="903">Galaxies</t>
 <t id="1001">Accelerator</t>
 <t id="1002">Built in many systems during the Jump Gate shutdown, accelerators allowed cut off star systems access to larger regions of their own space. Like super-highways, the technology for these accelerators is based off of more advanced Terran technology studied while the Sol system was still connected to the Jump Gate network.</t>

 <t id="10001">{20005,6002}(Grand Exchange)</t>
 <t id="10002">Shortly before the Jump Gate shutdown, when Gates would sporadically swap between active and inactive, in some systems on a daily bases, scientists across all races began to notice a worrying number of warp anomalies across all of {20003,10001}. Before they could be properly investigated, however, the Jump Gates to the system shut down completely.\n\nWhen the Gates reopened, scientists were quick to notice anomalies reappearing, though none as intense or frequent as previously. Though many resources have been dedicated to solving the mystery, none have yet been able to work out what is causing the anomalies.</t>

Though Teladi and Argon forces, and even a small contingent of Split ships, desperately tried to hold both systems, {20005, 6050}(PTNI Headquarters) was eventually lost.\n\nWhen the Jump Gates came back on line, Teladi Scouts from {20003,20001}(Eighteen Billion) quickly recognised the signs of the conflict, and when they found no trace of Xenon activity within the system, immediately set about on a recolonization effort.</t>

 <t id="60002">A famous hub of technical expertise before the Jump Gate shutdown, thanks largely to the people stationed there to stop the influx of Xenon activity from neighbouring Xenon Sector 472, {20003,60001} now enjoys an extended era of peace. Still, its people have remained busy, attempting to build a self-sufficient community in case history repeats itself.\n\nThough the system finds itself cut off from Argon Federation space by the Antigone Republic, a constant stream of supplies pours into the area, with the Federation desperate to show that no colony of theirs will be left to fend for itself.</t>

 <t id="110002">Though the Holy Order of the Pontifex does not yet have an officially recognised capital, it was from {20003,110001} that the Pontifex Maximus Haereticus \(name not supported by Holy Order\) was hatched and so has been claimed as the Order's capital once the Paranid Civil War has been concluded.\n\nA system only discovered in the surge of sporadic Jump Gate activity before the Jump Gate shutdown, {20003, 110001} only has Paranid colonies on parts of the single planet in system, though word has it that the Order is attempting to colonise it further.</t>

 <t id="130002">Within hours of the Jump Gates in {20003,130001} opening, fleets from both the Antigone Republic and the Holy Order of the Pontifex had arrived in system. Ownership of the system remained disputed for many years, with skirmishes from both factions commonplace.\n\nWith the start of the Paranid Civil War though, the Paranid could no longer afford to keep up their offensive and the Antigone Republic claimed the system as its own colony. Since, it has become a profitable trading hub, linking the Antigone Republic to the Argon Federation, and acts as a buffer to the Holy Order.</t>
 <t id="140001">{20005,1001}(Argon Prime)</t>
 <t id="140002">Colonised by the survivors of the First Terraformer War, the Sonra system is seen by many as the birthplace of modern Argon civilization and culture. Renamed from Sonra to R. Gunne to commemorate the hero of the First Terraformer War, then to {20003,140001}, the system has served as the capital of the Federation for all of its five hundred and eighty-four years. As such, the fourth planet, also called {20003,140001}, is steeped in history, and even despite the Jump Gate shutdown, the system once again thrives on a strong trading and tourist economy.</t>

 <t id="150002">The once long-lost home system of the Teladi, {20003,150001} once again faces a key moment in its history, acting after the Jump Gate shutdown as the buffer between Teladi space and the Xenon.\n\nThough there is less activity from {20003,160001}(Matrix #451) than other Xenon-occupied territories in the Jump Gate network, memories of the conflict in {20003,210001}(Scale Plate Green) and {20005,6050}(PTNI Headquarters) are still fresh in many Teladi minds, and they are determined to defend their home from the wrath of the machines. As such, it is heavily defended by both defence stations and a contingent of the Teladi fleet.</t>

 <t id="180001">{20005,3001}(Trinity Sanctum)</t>
 <t id="180002">Made famous before the Jump Gate shutdown by its nomadic workforce, whose expertise in raising delicate Maja snails was known across the entire network, {20003,180001} has been repurposed as the temporary capital of the Godrealm of the Paranid. The Snail Farms that were once so active here have long been shut down.\n\nDesperate to keep some sense of order among its people, the Pontifex Maximus Paranidia placed a heavily defended house of worship on one of the many moons of {20003,180001}, and so the system has also become a place of pilgrimage for many members of the Godrealm.</t>
 <t id="190001">{20005,6020}(Hewa's Twin)</t>
 <t id="190002">{20003,190001} may be the most widely, if not most thoroughly, explored system in Teladi territory, but has been somewhat crippled economically by its Jump Gate connection to {20003,180001}(Trinity Sanctum), separating it and {20003,200001}(Company Regard) from the rest of Teladi space.\n\nThe Paranids' differing views on what is legal and illegal sometimes makes it difficult for the Teladi Company to ferry supplies to citizens on both sides of the blockade. This however represents an interesting opportunity for smugglers, which the Scale Plate Pact pirates, who hide their headquarters somewhere in this system, have all too happily jumped on.</t>
 <t id="200001">{20005,6009}(Company Regard)</t>
 <t id="200002">A new star system only discovered after the Jump Gate realignment, {20003,200001} represents an opportunity for the Teladi Company to build an entirely new colony from scratch, as well as giving them the only access to the overrun colony of {20003,210001}(Scale Plate Green).\n\nThough a small number of military staff and crew have moved into the system to help control Xenon incursions from {20003,210001}(Scale Plate Green), proper colonisation work in {20003,200001} has been slow, as no habitable planets and no mineral or gas regions have yet to be discovered.</t>

 <t id="210002">Once a pride of Teladi Company space, {20003,210001} was overrun by the Xenon early in the period of the Jump Gate shutdown. Despite fearless defending from the Company and its allies, the Xenon fleet proved too strong, annihilating those that did not flee.\n\nSince it was reconnected to the network, Teladi scouts have recorded that {20003,210001} continues to be heavily defended by the Xenon, acting as a staging area for incursions into both Teladi and Paranid space.</t>

 <t id="230002">Long the heart of the Paranid scientific community, with its mysterious planet and one lone relic of a distant past, {20003,230001} quickly became the home of the Alliance of the Word during the Jump Gate shutdown, and has since remained a place of discovery and exploration for all across the Jump Gate network.\n\nIt was from here that the first AoW drones were launched to {20003,140001}(Argon Prime) and {20005,2009}(Kingdom End), and also the location of the Alliance's single shipyard, where they aim to launch generation ships to send aid to systems still thought disconnected from any Jump Gates.</t>

 <t id="250001">{20005,3008}(Faulty Logic)</t>
 <t id="250002">Having had less direct contact with the Xenon than other races, and with their superior understanding of mathematics, the Paranid have always tolerated artificial intelligence more than other races. However, after the loss of {20005,3028}(Emperor Mines) - now called {20003,250001} - they also know the risks that come with it, having seen one of their most secure systems overrun through a Xenon logic bomb. While every Paranid ship lay paralysed in space, the Xenon wiped them out. Many Paranid have since begun to wonder whether their tolerance for the machines has made them susceptible to further assault.</t>
 <t id="260001">{20005,9014}(Atiya's Misfortune)</t>
 <t id="260002">In the Terrans' attempts to expand beyond their borders in the latter days of the Terran Conflict, systems such as Toride and {20003,260001} became beacons of hope for a race that was lost and broken. However, scared and on the run, the Terrans did not properly scout their colony locations. While Toride's fate is still unknown, {20003,260001} was quickly discovered to contain a heavy Xenon presence, forcing the Terrans to flee once more.\n\nArgon and Paranid scouts have since been able to map out most of the system, in the hope that one day the Xenon can be cleared out.</t>

 <t id="280002">Once an Argon Federation border system that survived one of the worst Xenon incursions in Argon history, {20003,280001} made it through the shutdown through the sheer willpower of its people, who banded together and unified in order to make sure their beloved home did not once again become crippled by such dark times.\n\nIt now serves as the capital of the fledgling Antigone Republic and has seen a long stretch of peace and growth due to its distance from both major Xenon threats and the Holy Order of the Pontifex.</t>
 <t id="290001">{20005,1015}(Hatikvah's Choice)</t>
 <t id="290002">Placed on the highway construction known as The Ring, {20003,290001} is home to both the Hatikvah Free League and many Federation citizens, and is one of the busiest systems in Argon space. Even without a habitable planet - consisting instead of several nebulae, an asteroid field and a colossal gas giant - the system continues to flourish. Its position on the Ring, as well as security from the neighbouring {20003,140001}(Argon Prime), means the system is not only an ideal economic community but is also seen as a safe place for all that wish to escape the ongoing struggles of the Jump Gate network.</t>
 <t id="300001">{20005,1006}(Morning Star)</t>
 <t id="300002">One of the dozen Argon colonies destroyed during the First Terraformer War, {20003,300001} was only rediscovered after the most recent Jump Gate realignment, with archaeologists still uncovering many of the homes and factories laid to waste by the Terraformers during the conflict.\n\nThough the Argon Federation has begun the process to resettle the system, work has been slow, as the Gate connection to {20003,320001}(Tharka's Cascade) has seen a steady stream of Xenon incursions into the system. Naturally, this has made {20003,300001} a high priority for strong defence by the Federal Navy, and along with its civilian traffic, a large military presence is often found here.</t>
 <t id="310001">{20005,9015}(Heretic's End)</t>
 <t id="310002">Originally discovered and claimed by the Paranid, {20003,310001} became one of the most famous systems in the Jump Gate network after the building and activation of the Earth Gate and the massive battle between the Kha'ak and combined Terran and Commonwealth forces. While {20003,1000001}(Sol) remained connected to the Jump Gate network, {20003,310001} remained under heavy Terran protection, but when it became obvious that Jump Gates were failing too quickly for the connection to possibly remain stable, the system was swiftly abandoned, fading back into obscurity. Now, it serves as a backwater colony that holds only interest to pirates and smugglers.</t>
 <t id="320001">{20005,5001}(Tharka's Cascade)</t>
 <t id="320002">{20003,320001} represents the last evidence available to the Jump Gate network that the Split Patriarchy survived the Jump Gate shutdown. Relatively unexplored due to both natural dangers and the unhindered spread of Xenon fleets throughout the system, its name is only known because of a brief Argon Federation scouting mission that uncovered the passages of a member of Family Tharka as she attempted to flee the area in the face of an as of yet unknown danger referred to in the files as 'the Fade'.</t>

 <t id="340002">Situated between two uninhabitable dust planets, this Teladi system once produced raw materials and light weapons for military and exploration ships. It was earmarked by the Profit Guild before the Jump Gate shutdown for priority expansion and investment.\n\nAs chance would have it, after the realignment, {20003,340001} became ideally situated for such investment, finding itself placed on The Ring after the Jump Gate fluctuation stabilised. The Teladi Company were only too happy to allow such a highway construction to be built through the system in order to allow quicker and more efficient profit.</t>

 <t id="130012">Many of the disputes between the Paranid and the Argon before the outbreak of the Paranid Civil War occurred here, as it is the sector in which the Gates to {20003,270001}(The Void) and {20003,120001}(True Sight) are both situated. Though the Antigone Republic have worked hard to clear the evidence of their turmoil away, much remains, and many still come to {20005,1019}(Flashpoint) to honour the memory of the dead.\n\nThis sector also represents The Republic's strongest economic sector, as it is the only one that is part of The Ring. It is the most highly populated sector claimed by the faction.</t>

 <t id="190012">The sector closest to the planet Ak within the {20003,190001}(Hewa's Twin) system, this is perhaps the only sector in the system that can be regarded as truly 'busy'. Home to one of the Teladi Company's early prototype Habitat-class superstations, it sees regular traffic both from the planet surface and the neighbouring {20003,180001}(Trinity Sanctum) system, and also has the highest population of the system. This makes the sector the closest thing to a trading hub the Teladi Company can ask for, while they try to convince the Godrealm of the Paranid to allow wares such as spaceweed through Paranid space.</t>
 <t id="190021">{20003,190001} {20402,2}(Hewa's Twin II)</t>
 <t id="190022">This sector is home to a few pockets of natural resources and a largely unexplored space that sees traffic heading towards the more profitable {20004,430011}(Hewa's Twin V) or military vessels headed to {20003,200001}(Company Regard).\n\nEven though the sector does not hold much future economic value, it is on the traffic lane towards Ak and remains a beautiful area of space, and as such the Teladi Company have marked it as a possible tourist and rest-and-relaxation destination to be developed in the near future.</t>

 <t id="210012">Once the heart of Scale Plate Green's strong economy, this sector contains many natural resources that can no longer be accessed due to small Xenon fleets protecting both the Gate from {20003,200001}(Company Regard) and the superhighway onwards through the system. \n\nThough Teladi scouts continue to keep a constant eye on the colony they so desperately want back, shipyards keeping the Xenon fleets in supply mean it is still too dangerous to consider a counter offensive.\n\nUntil that offensive is possible, the wreck fields of {20004,210011} serve as a strong reminder as to why the Xenon should not be underrated.</t>
 <t id="210021">{20003,210001} {20402,7}(Scale Plate Green VII)</t>
 <t id="210022">Home to the corporate sector of the Teladi Company's business in {20003,210001}(Scale Plate Green), this sector was perhaps the least prepared for the Xenon incursion that hit the system so hard.\n\nWith most of the Teladi and Argon forces already struggling to maintain their defence in {20004,210011}(Scale Plate Green I), and the Split refusing to send more aid after their contingent was annihilated in the second wave of attacks, many of the stations were destroyed before the people on them knew what hit them, and civilian ships in the area had no choice but to flee or be eliminated as well.</t>

 <t id="250012">After the initial Xenon assault on {20005,3028}(Emperor Mines), and with as many civilians rescued as possible, Olmanckarsat turned their attention to protecting other core Paranid systems from the Xenon invasion.\n\nCalling in reinforcements from {20005,3012}(Paranid Prime), Olmanckarsat headed straight for Xenon Sector 101, predicting that the Xenon had launched everything they had at {20005,3028}(Emperor Mines). The Xenon were quick to follow the fleet back through the Jump Gate and Olmanckarsat immediately ordered the destruction of the Jump Gate on the other side. The Paranid fleet were trapped in Xenon territory, presumably destroyed, but Paranid space was safe.</t>
 <t id="250021">{20003,250001} {20402,7}(Faulty Logic VII)</t>
 <t id="250022">When the North Gate of {20005,3028}(Emperor Mines) opened up into Xenon Sector 101, the Paranid core systems were caught completely off-guard. The Xenon struck with lightning speed, crippling all Paranid defences within minutes and systematically wiping out everything in-system.\n\nIt was only due to the quick thinking of Olmanckarsat, a Paranid fleet commander, that any escape was possible at all.\n\nRecognising that the crippled Paranid fleet could do very little against a superior enemy, Olmanckarsat ordered the Paranid to instead kite the enemy away from stations and civilian traffic, destroying small pockets of Xenon before moving on to the next target.</t>

It was here that the Terrans are said to have first run into the Xenon threat that forced them to flee the system, with the Inquisitors' Wrath almost immediately destroyed as smaller combat ships and transporters fled the burning wreck of the M1 Tokyo-class carrier.\n\nSo heavy is the Xenon presence in this sector that no Argon or Paranid scout has been able to recover a full report of the area.</t>

 <t id="260022">Though stories of what happened in {20003,260001}(Atiya's Misfortune) are yet to be confirmed, with no trace of the Terran colonisation attempt left by the Xenon, it is said that the Terrans' escape from the system was made possible by two highly skilled fighter pilots, Darayavahush and Atiya Hakim.\n\nWhen Atiya was killed as the two pilots, the last to leave the system, fled, Darayavahush - her twin - fell into a deep state of bitterness and depression, disappearing from society and travelling the Jump Gate network, as it was before the shutdown, never to be seen again.</t>

 <t id="290021">{20003,290001} {20402,3}(Hatikvah's Choice III)</t>
 <t id="290022">After accepting that the Hatikvah Free League had first right to colonisation in {20003,290001} after their long trek across the Jump Gate network, the Argon Federation quickly explored other areas of the system in order to their dire need for more space as more and more Jump Gates reconnected to the network. This sector was believed to hold the most promise for a colony, located deep in the systems asteroid field and with plenty of space for expansion.</t>

 <t id="300012">This is a quiet sector, situated on the edge of the sphere of influence belonging to {20004,300011}.

 <t id="320012">The uncovered passages of She t'Tharka tell that it was in this sector that the Split ships - mostly civilian transporters and supply ships - desperately attempting to flee 'The Fade' were systematically cut down, destroyed one by one until none remained. It is unknown if any of the Split, including She, survived, as her final passages have not yet been found.\n\nDespite the dangers this sector presents, with permanent electro-magnetic nebulae that cripple ship shields, the Xenon defend this sector with an almost fervent vigour, with entire fleets often defending both the Jump Gate and the superhighway to {20004,320021}(Tharka's Cascade XVII).</t>

 <t id="390012">With an impressive view of the planet Ikssaar and its moon, Haarri, this sector has only recently been claimed by the Teladi Company and is yet to be thoroughly explored.\n\nThe Teladi Company hope to turn the sector into a haven for farming and agriculture, but have first focused on clearing the area of wreckage left behind by the Xenon invasion prior to the Jump Gate shutdown.\n\nColonisation of the sector is currently slow, though its relative security gives the Company confidence that the situation will improve.</t>

 <t id="400012">Though many of the exchanges between the Paranid and the Argon in {20003,130001} occurred in {20005,1019}, perhaps the biggest actually occurred here. The battle was won because of the snap decision made by Fleet Admiral Siy Keswen to launch an offensive against the Paranid, still preparing their forces on the outskirts of the system.\n\nThe battle proved difficult, with the Paranid outnumbering the then fledgling Antigone Republic fleet, but Keswen was able to pull his people through, and the Argon were able to force the Paranid to flee back towards {20003,120001}, giving the Antigone another day of respite.</t>
 <t id="410011">{20003,410001} {20402,11}(Second Contact XI)</t>
 <t id="410012">After the Battle at {20004,400011}, the Antigone Argon were safely able to colonise this sector, for the surprise halt in fighting caused by Admiral Keswen's brave attack.\n\nThe sector has since become a small haven for the Antigone Republic - one that they are incredibly proud of. Rich with natural resources and within touching distance of the moon, Icon, from which you can be swiftly transported to the planet aptly named Sanctuary, the sector has seen a lot of growth since the start of the Paranid Civil War, and many hope it remains so when the conflict ends.</t>

 <t id="420012">Set against a backdrop of blue-green nebulae, this has been one of the sectors hardest hit by the Paranid blockade of Teladi goods being ferried across {20003,180001}(Trinity Sanctum). Too far away from the planet Ak to receive direct supply, the sector is often seen as a sector to travel through, as opposed to stay in.\n\nIt can sometimes see a lot of traffic, particularly from miners on their way to  {20004,430011}(Hewa's Twin V), but the sector holds a low population and, as such, the Teladi Company are targeting it for development in the future.</t>

 <t id="420022">When it became obvious that the Godrealm of the Paranid would not simply let the Teladi Company transport wares such as spaceweed through {20003,180001}(Trinity Sanctum) to Teladi space surrounding it, the Scale Plate Pact quickly jumped at the opportunity to smuggle these wares through the system instead, taking them not just to Teladi space, but further to Argon and Paranid territory too.\n\nThese operations made it necessary to set up a base of operations on the quieter side of the blockade, and {20005,6027}(The Cove), explored but not claimed by the Teladi Company, presented the perfect place for this headquarters.</t>
 <t id="430011">{20003,430001} {20402,5}(Hewa's Twin V)</t>
 <t id="430012">This sector has been earmarked by the Teladi Company as a potentially lucrative asteroid field and is located on the very outskirts of the solar region of Ak. It is famed for the discovery of a data slab found while exploring the sector, reading in eggspeak, "This is the gateway to adventure's promise. Have fun! ISNF."\n\nThough Teladi who live on Ak itself have little reason to travel this far out, there is a small and growing community of miners and farmers that have made their home here because of the security and room for development.</t>

 <t id="10111">Long serving as the scout and exploration ship for the Argon fleet, the Discoverer saw little re-design or overhaul until the Jump Gate shutdown. The current model, an overall improvement on the model used before the shutdown, was designed in the Antigone Republic and made available to the Argon Federation as part of an ongoing technology exchange between the two allied factions.</t>

 <t id="10311">Though the prototype for the new-model Nova-class dogfighter was in development as far back as the Terran Conflict, it never reached mass-production before the Jump Gate shutdown. As such, its first major role was as an escort to Argon Federation exploratory groups that were sent out into newly discovered or rediscovered areas of space as the Jump Gates began to realign.\n\nIn terms of its class, the new-look Nova is a major step up in ship design, with rotatable engines that make it formidable in keeping up with and tracking targets of a similar size.</t>

 <t id="10403">(Eclipse Sentinel){20101,10401} {20111,1201}</t>
 <t id="10411">Redesigned using the same combat-ready cockpit used by the new-look Nova, the Eclipse replaces the rotatable engines with a support structure that allows it to carry more weapons - effectively sacrificing the manoeuvrability of the dog-fighter for enough fire-power to be devastating against both small- and medium-sized ships.\n\nThis sacrifice does make the ship vulnerable to more specialised dog-fighters and interceptors, but nonetheless both the Federal and Republic navy has found the new Eclipse to be a worthy addition to their fleets, with Argon ship designers once again leading the race to design ships effective for both personal and military use.</t>

 <t id="10511">A ship that saw much upheaval behind the scenes during the Terran Conflict, when it became painfully clear to the Argon that their ships were far inferior to the Terran equivalents, the Minotaur was over the course of the conflict completely redesigned as a mobile weapons-platform, sporting heavy weapons that deal incredible amounts of damage to similarly-sized and larger, slower targets. Unfortunately, the ship was unable to be put into mass-production before crisis crippled the Argon Federation, and as a result the new Minotaur has only recently entered service.</t>

 <t id="10611">The first of the newly-designed M-sized support ships to reach the Federal and Republic navies, the Cerberus-class frigate is primarily designed to target and support smaller and similarly-sized vessels in a defensive capacity. Notably, the Cerberus was also the first ship of its size to support a fully-functional dock for smaller ships; a massive technical challenge for its designers. This has only made it a more popular choice of ship, and saw a new design race explode throughout the Jump Gate network as other ship designers scrambled to copy the Argons' innovative design.</t>

 <t id="10711">The latest redesign of the Mercury-class transporter was almost purely aesthetic, with only small changes made to allow the user more modularity and modification options. Other than the aesthetic changes made to keep the model in line with latest style trends, the Mercury remains the same reliable M-sized transporter that has seen popular use across Argon space for so many years.</t>

 <t id="10811">Towards the end of the last era, the Plutarch Mining Corporation called for a shift away from static station-based asteroid mining towards the far more efficient method of using ships to identify and break down asteroids and bring them to refineries in far less time than it took for a refinery to be attached to a much bigger asteroid. Though it is now different from the PMC's original design, the Drill has been in service ever since, inspiring a train of different mining ships to be released all across the old and new Jump Gate network.</t>

 <t id="10911">Jonferco's response to the PMC's Drill design, the Sunder fulfils a similar role to its sister ship but handles gas collection instead of asteroid mining. It is fitted with a non-modular scoop that allows natural gases to be safely placed inside the ship's cargo hold. For all the gratitude received by PMC for their work in advancing asteroid mining, Jonferco's reply sent the mining community into a complete frenzy, with the possibilities for collecting, refining and utilising natural gases spurring the economy, not just in Argon space but across the entire Jump Gate network, to a brand new high.</t>

 <t id="11011">The original design of the Behemoth-class destroyer was put into development mid-way through the Kha'ak conflict, during which the Titan-class was beginning to show its age and inefficiencies. At first too expensive for a crippled Argon economy, then too complex to produce quickly during the Terran Conflict, the first Behemoth did not ship out until long after that war had ended, and the Jump Gates had begun to catastrophically fail. It was only when Argon Prime and Black Hole Sun came back into contact that the Behemoth could be rolled out more frequently.</t>

 <t id="11111">As the trend towards collecting natural resources with ships continued, the inefficiencies of the solution started to become clear. While a medium-sized ship had the advantage of moving quickly through mineral and gas regions, their cargo bays were simply not big enough for industrial-scale mining to be lucrative.\n\nNaturally, the Teladi stepped in to design L-sized resource collectors that could solve that problem, and the Magnetar is the Argon response to these ships; a standardised model that can be built in two variants, allowing it to support both asteroid mining and natural gas collection.</t>

 <t id="11211">Designed and produced by the Antigone Republic after the Jump Gates began to realign, the Veles-class freighter is more compact and self-sufficient than any freighter-class ship before it; the reason why it became part of the on-going technology exchange between the Republic and their Argon Federation allies.\n\nBuilt using a highly modular design, many ship designers have taken the base Veles model and reorganised it, as well as making their own changes to the internal systems, to sell an ever-growing number of variations on the ship. However, the Veles remains a popular choice among traders and station builders.</t>

 <t id="11311">The final ship shared with the Argon Federation by the Antigone Republic as part of their ongoing technology exchange, the new-look Colossus-class carrier was initially designed as such so that it didn't use much-needed resources that were sorely lacking in Antigone Memorial during the Jump Gate shutdown.\n\nWith an array of medium and small docks and launch tubes, the Antigone Colossus is a significant improvement on other Colossus models, able to deploy ships to the battlefield at a much higher rate and collect and store them far more efficiently, at the cost of some of its previous firepower.</t>

 <t id="11411">With the method of building stations having changed numerous times since the beginning of the Jump Gate shutdown, many have questioned the necessity for a dedicated building vessel, but the Mammoth has continued to find purpose.\n\nUndergoing changes with every iteration of the station building method, the last iteration of the Mammoth saw it transformed into more of a mobile platform than a ship; becoming immobile when deployed to a station construction site so that construction drones can easily be ferried from the ship to the site and back again.</t>

 <t id="11511">Very quickly developed during the course of the latest defence against the Xenon, the Nomad is effectively a mobile equipment dock, allowing combat ships to repair and restock and get back to the fight more quickly. This has greatly helped the efficiency of both the Argon Federation and Antigone Republic fleets, and has already begun to see clones created across both Teladi and Paranid space.\n\nThe ship is not self-sufficient, requiring a defensive escort not to be torn apart in combat. If it can be defended though, the Nomad can prove a devastating support ship.</t>

 <t id="11611">After years of outcry from many a trader about the lack of a small and speedy transporter, the up and coming ship manufacturer Jinko-Tekina have supplied both the Argon Federation and Antigone Memorial with the Courier-class s-ship, designed for transporting small numbers of valuable wares across a short distance in order to limit the risk of hijacking as well as to share the load of M- and L-sized transporters that make up the rest of the Argon merchant fleet.</t>

 <t id="11711">With the Argon Federation desperate to rebuild its economy after the Jump Gates realigned, the sheer number of Mercury-class transporters across Argon space became so high that the value of the popular transporter began to sink rapidly. In an attempt to correct course, the Federation released the Ides. Though they are only slightly aesthetically and technically different, and in fact the Ides is based on the Mercury model, the ship has been pushed as competition to the popular transporter; a marketing strategy that has been well met by the public, and recently allowed for the ship market to find stability.</t>

 <t id="11811">When Argon Federation ship designers received the blue-prints for the Veles, it was immediately recognisable as a highly modular ship, and so they began work straight away on different variations that could provide more variety and competition in a ship class that was both needed and popular throughout Argon space.\n\nOne of the first ships to come from this process was the Mokosi, designed in Black Hole Sun. Though it uses the same base chassis as the Veles, a different container configuration and tweaks to several internal systems to adapt have created a fine addition to the Argon merchant fleet.</t>

 <t id="101">Badlands Colony</t>
 <t id="102">Originally installed by the Plutarch Mining Corporation, the so called Badlands Colony, not actually a colony but a mining operation, was however repurposed after the Albion gate powered down and as since served as an actual colony and stronghold to PMC senior staff. The fragment of the Broken Moon the station was built into had supposedly been chosen due to a large tunnel leading all the way from one side of the rock to the other allowing easy access to its interior through many shafts driven into its walls. One part of the installation still serves as a mining facility and is commonly referred to as The Mines.</t>
 <t id="201">Lonely Giant</t>
 <t id="202">Probably a candidate for the title of Profiteroid 2.0 the Lonely Giant brims with a strange concentration of 99% pure Hydrogen-3 in crystalline form. The visible crystals on the surface only amount for a tiny fraction of what deep scans have revealed to be immense chasms on the inside filled up with frozen Hydrogen-3. However, both the reason why the Lonely giant did not yet melt under the heat of Albion's central star nor willingly spread its wealth is the immensely hard silicate a majority of the rock is made up from, giving the PMC a hard time twisting its innards. For the meantime the two massive rocks orbiting one another are held in a containment field trapping the subliming Hydrogen-3 gas emanating from the surface crystals with the pretty side-effect of illuminating the whole scene in a soothing picturesque turquoise as the gas touches the particle barrier.</t>
 <t id="301">Core Dig</t>
 <t id="302">The Core Dig was the most prominent source for the Iridium isotope Ir-209, also known as the famous 'Unobtainium'. This is a stable and highly heat-resistant anti-ferromagnetic complex agent perfectly suited for fusion reaction containment. Such containment suffered from the previous lack of a material that was not also radio-activated under constant neutron radiation. Iridium-209, formerly considered non-existent in nature and ineffective through cost to synthesise, seemed to fit the bill. Unfortunately, as Matter/Antimatter technology emerged and increased its hold on the reactor market, Unobtainium faced a severe decline in demand and resale value compared to the cost of extraction and processing. The Core Dig now operates with a reduced crew and has redirected its operations to extract and store the trace Nividium also present in the minerals available.</t>
 <t id="401">Lost Colony</t>
 <t id="402">The crude technology this large installation is based on still bears a glimpse of genius. Its core consists of a series of tunnel connections between some junction structures of different sizes upon which the surrounding gases were made to condense and crystallize under the influence of a chemical catalyst. Today the station has a crystalline coating of varying thickness between 100 and 500 Metres and will most likely form a solid asteroid-like mega-crystal a couple hundred years from now. The Lost Colony already has pioneers dig into the thicker areas of the coating expanding the station into it with some success now which makes it clear that this colony may very well grow into something far more befitting of such name.</t>
 <t id="601">The Aqueduct</t>
 <t id="602">As the M/AM drives gained popularity this behemoth among freshwater supply stations was quickly abandoned in favour of more readily accessible water sources. Before that however the Aqueduct was the Maelstrom system's largest freshwater supply installation and probably one of the largest facilities of its kind in the known universe. Today it is being swarmed by Xenon who lurk within the dense clouds of frozen H2O that span the space between the many asteroids around the Sable Vortex.</t>
 <t id="701">The Maze</t>
 <t id="702">Named for the countless natural and artificial tunnels that snake through it, the Maze is the huge broken asteroid in which the Jump Gate in Fields of Opportunity is situated. The nature of the tunnels, which run from one end of the asteroid to the other, lead the Teladi to believe that the Maze was broken up for mining by one of the system's previous occupants, though there is no evidence to suggest who these settlers may have been.</t>
 <t id="801">Overwatch</t>
 <t id="802">Though Overwatch still receives a supply of Teladianium from the foundries in Fields of Opportunity, after a Jump Gate realignment the Habitat-class "superstation" was cut off from most of the technology it requires to manufacture ships from its dedicated shipyard. Even though it now depends on Albion for these technologies, Overwatch still has much to offer the system, since it provides food and energy to all the stations still scattered across Serpentine Haze and Fatal Path. More importantly, however, it is home to thousands of Teladi civilians and the headquarters of the Teladi Union, making it the first port of call for any traveller coming to Fields of Opportunity.</t>
 <t id="901">War Memorial</t>
 <t id="902">The Teladi of Fields of Opportunity have always struggled against the Xenon that exist on the outskirts of the system, but mass incursions into the system by the Xenon are rare. When they have occurred, however, they have always ended in bloodshed. The so-called "War Memorial" is perhaps the largest of the battle scars, and was left in the far north of Serpentine Haze in commemoration of the Teladi who sacrificed themselves to make sure their comrades would escape unharmed.\n\nRealising that they did not have the firepower to push the Xenon back, three Teladi captains ordered their crews to abandon ship before ramming the Branch 9 Xenon K leading the attack and causing it to crash into the side of an asteroid. The subsequent explosion destroyed everything in the vicinity, but ended what had been one of the Teladi's most vicious and bloody conflicts.</t>

 <t id="100101">Habitat Ring Extension</t>
 <t id="100102">This module extends the Habitat-class superstation so that it can support additional modules behind its primary ring. These attach to the extension module in a spoke-like fashion.</t>
 <t id="100201">Habitat Ring Column</t>
 <t id="100202">Used primarily for structural support between a Habitat-class superstation's centre and its primary ring, this spoke-like column also holds quarters for the station's workers and inhabitants.</t>
 <t id="100301">Habitat Centre Complex</t>
 <t id="100302">Forming the heart of the Habitat-class superstation, the HCC houses most of its administrative sectors, as well as about a third of its living space.</t>
 <t id="100401">Habitat City</t>
 <t id="100402">Placed in the inner-side of the Habitat-class superstation's primary ring, the city is home to thousands of citizens and station workers. When designing the station, the Teladi Company attempted to make the city suitable not just for Teladi, but for as many species as possible, and so it is not unusual to find cities with many different biomes.</t>
 <t id="100501">Habitat Centre Ring</t>
 <t id="100502">Forming the central structural support to the Habitat-class superstation's primary ring, this small ring also extends from the Habitat Centre Complex to act as an entrance to the station for any ships that wish to dock.</t>
 <t id="100601">Habitat Trade Centre</t>
 <t id="100602">These components of the Habitat-class superstation house huge trading floors where official and civilian traders can go to trade wares and produce.</t>
 <t id="100701">Habitat Bridge</t>
 <t id="100702">As well as acting as secondary support for the Habitat-class superstation's primary ring, the bridge also provides high-speed transport from the ring to the complex centre and ring extension, allowing citizens and station workers to travel around the station.</t>

 <t id="100">(*PRODUCED WARES*)</t>
 <t id="101">Advanced Electronics</t>
 <t id="102">Designed specifically to work alongside weapon and turret components, it is a variety of advanced electronics that allow different weapons and turrets to have a range of turning speeds, fire rates and cooldowns. Whereas field coils for shields and antimatter converters for engines are more modular and can be used 'across the board', different weapons and turrets expect different electronic systems to be used in order to ensure the correct properties. However, as all equipment is built and repaired on demand, all advanced electronics are shipped to shipyards and equipment docks together.</t>
 <t id="104">Advanced Electronics Factory</t>
 <t id="201">Antimatter Cells</t>
 <t id="202">Highly advanced magnetic storage devices that carry antimatter. Due to the effect of Hawking radiation and their being self-powered, antimatter cells cannot store antimatter indefinitely. They are produced and filled using refined hydrogen and primarily used in the production of engine parts, and also can be miniaturised to be used in claytronics.</t>
 <t id="204">Antimatter Cell Factory</t>
 <t id="301">Antimatter Converters</t>
 <t id="302">Attached to the antimatter cells used in engine parts for both main engines and thrusters, antimatter converters fine-tune the amount of energy used to a more specific configuration. It is the use of this component that allows so many variations of engine, as their number and set up greatly impact the power and efficiency of the final product.</t>
 <t id="304">Antimatter Converter Factory</t>
 <t id="401">Advanced Composites</t>
 <t id="402">Formed from some of the refined resources collected from mining ships, advanced composites is a general term for many compounds created to serve several purposes; most commonly used in the production of a variety of equipment parts.</t>
 <t id="404">Advanced Composite Factory</t>
 <t id="501">Claytronics</t>
 <t id="502">More commonly known as programmable matter, claytronics are made up of millions of individual nanometre-scale computers known as catoms. This technology lives at the heart of any non-Xenon station, used to build anything from internal wiring to computer systems and control mechanisms - effectively everything but the hull of the station itself. Claytronics are always in high-demand, as the universe rebuilds itself after the Jump Gate shutdown.</t>
 <t id="504">Claytronics Factory</t>
 <t id="601">Drone Components</t>
 <t id="602">Much like weapon and turret components, drone components have been generalised and standardised across much of the Jump Gate network to be modularly used in all kinds of drone, making them a highly sought-after resource. Drone components are directly shipped to shipyards, equipment docks and stations to source drone-building, which is done on-demand as and when it is necessary.</t>
 <t id="604">Drone Component Factory</t>
 <t id="701">Energy Cells</t>
 <t id="702">Contrary to common belief, Energy Cells are not simply glorified batteries; actually, they are sophisticated bio-chemical \(or bio-mechanical, depending on technology\) devices capable of storing energy near or at 100% efficiency.</t>
 <t id="704">Solar Power Plant</t>
 <t id="801">Engine Parts</t>
 <t id="802">Comprised of a number of different components that make up ship engines, engine parts are delivered straight to the end customer, most commonly shipyards and equipment docks, who then use them themselves to produce or repair engines. While naturally engine parts are a very necessary resource across the entire Jump Gate network, the ability to produce and repair engines on demand, instead of requiring an entirely separate production step for each, has greatly streamlined the universal economy.</t>
 <t id="804">Engine Part Factory</t>
 <t id="901">Field Coils</t>
 <t id="902">Used to fine-tune the arrays used on ship and station shielding, field coils allow for much more modulation than using shield components alone. As such shipyards have begun using them to build a much wider variety of shields than was previously available. Like many of the components used on ships - that aren't the hull itself - shield components are shipped straight to shipyards and equipment docks so that shields can be produced on-demand.</t>
 <t id="904">Field Coil Factory</t>
 <t id="1001">Flares</t>
 <t id="1002">A piece of equipment tried and tested over hundreds of years, the modern flare has continued to be a boon for many a combat pilot in recent years. Forcibly ejected from a compartment of a ship, flares then explode so that the sudden heat signature may distract a guided missile from its original target, and before exploding additionally send out a small electro-magnetic signature that can disrupt a target lock before a missile is even fired.</t>
 <t id="1004">Flare Factory</t>
 <t id="1101">Food Rations</t>
 <t id="1102">Food Rations come in a large variety; as far as rations for the species Homo sapiens are concerned, they mainly contain wheat, freeze-dried meat and different spices as well as vitamins and essential minerals.</t>
 <t id="1104">Food Ration Factory</t>
 <t id="1201">Hull Parts</t>
 <t id="1202">Made from refined metals or teladianium, Hull Parts are most commonly used to build the hulls of ships and stations, though they do have some other uses such as in drones and weapons. Usually layered for additional protection, and using other compounds to further reinforce, Hull Parts are still cheap to produce - a bonus, considering their position as the most frequently used resource in the Jump Gate network.</t>
 <t id="1204">Hull Part Factory</t>
 <t id="1301">Hydrogen</t>
 <t id="1302">Historically, Hydrogen has been used mainly in H-fusion generators. These days however, with the rise of sustainable M/AM mass conversion, Hydrogen is routinely converted into anti-Hydrogen for use in Antimatter Cells.</t>
 <t id="1304">Hydrogen Extractor</t>
 <t id="1401">Ice</t>
 <t id="1402">H2O in its solid state of aggregation, used for industrial water supplies and general consumption after treatment.</t>
 <t id="1404">Ice Mine</t>
 <t id="1501">Graphene</t>
 <t id="1502">Produced from refined and heavily modified methane gas in the modern era, graphene is a semi-metal that has many uncommon properties. Due to its strength and resistance to heat and electricity, it is used to produce a variety of tech-level resources, and is also used to help in the reinforcement of hull parts.</t>
 <t id="1504">Graphene Refinery</t>
 <t id="1601">Methane</t>
 <t id="1602">Found in ample supply in gas nebulas across the Jump Gate network, methane \(CH4\) is collected by mining ships and taken to refineries to be processed into graphene.</t>
 <t id="1604">Methane Extractor</t>
 <t id="1801">Maja Dust</t>
 <t id="1802">Chemically processed from crushed maja snail shells, maja dust is a relaxant and hallucinogenic sold as a powder-substance that is inhaled. Though any official Paranid government would have the populous believe that maja dust is not commonly consumed, it is thought to be highly likely, particularly in light of the ongoing Paranid civil war, that many Paranid and non-Paranid alike are partaking in the outlawed substance.</t>
 <t id="1804">Maja Dust Factory</t>
 <t id="1901">Maja Snails</t>
 <t id="1902">Grown across many Paranid colonies, as well as in tanks across Paranid space, maja snails provide Paranid with a good number of the nutrients they need to survive. Commonly treated very well, once a snail dies its shell and flesh are both processed as part of soja husk, along with soja beans. The shell of the maja snail is also commonly used as the main ingredient of the drug known as maja dust.</t>
 <t id="1904">Maja Snail Farm</t>
 <t id="2001">Meat</t>
 <t id="2002">Though meat comes in a great variety, the most sought-after type as of late is so-called 'vegan meat', synthesised and cloned not from real animals, but from cell cultures. However, real Argnu meat is still popular within the human population of many worlds.</t>
 <t id="2004">Meat Factory</t>
 <t id="2101">Medical Supplies</t>
 <t id="2102">Medical supplies contain a number of different concoctions and remedies used to keep station workforce healthier and happier during their time aboard. Completely natural in design, these supplies have been vetted by both the Argon Federation and Godrealm of the Paranid to ensure they are both legal and safe, and thus there is no licence necessary to carry or supply them.</t>
 <t id="2104">Medical Supply Factory</t>
 <t id="2201">Microchips</t>
 <t id="2202">Used in a wide variety of equipment parts, micro-chips are produced using silicon wafers, which, while fragile, allows them to conduct at a much higher rate. This, in turn, allows far better processing in the equipment that uses the micro-chips, which includes many advanced electronics and components.</t>
 <t id="2204">Microchip Factory</t>
 <t id="2301">Missile Components</t>
 <t id="2302">Missile components are used in the construction of all missiles, often with a different number and configuration making up the construction of each missile. As with ship equipment, missiles are built on demand, and so missile components are bought at and found at shipyards and equipment docks, where most pilots can order missiles on demand.</t>
 <t id="2304">Missile Component Factory</t>
 <t id="2401">Nividium</t>
 <t id="2402">A rare metal found in small pockets in asteroids, Nividium has been cut out of any economic use by the improved efficiency with which businesses have been able to use ore and silicon, much easier to find and cheaper to process. However, Nividium is still valuable, and is often transported planet-side to be made into jewelry and art.</t>
 <t id="2404">Nividium Mine</t>
 <t id="2601">Nostrop Oil</t>
 <t id="2602">Nostrop oil is squeezed from the leaves of sunrise flowers and mixed with water. Though the Teladi favour it for its simplicity and nutrients, other species have clearly indicated that nostrop oil does not in fact taste at all pleasing.</t>
 <t id="2604">Nostrop Oil Factory</t>
 <t id="2701">Ore</t>
 <t id="2702">Today ore tends not to be mined on habitable worlds, but harvested from other celestial bodies, mainly asteroids. As could be expected, Ore must always be refined to be of any use.</t>
 <t id="2704">Ore Mine</t>
 <t id="2801">Helium</t>
 <t id="2802">A colourless, odourless and non-toxic noble gas, helium is found in great abundance in gas nebulas across the entire Jump Gate network and is usually collected by mining ships to be refined into superfluid coolant.</t>
 <t id="2804">Helium Extractor</t>
 <t id="2901">Superfluid Coolant</t>
 <t id="2902">Designed with superfluidity to ensure both efficiency and endurance, this coolant is used in complex technical components such as plasma conductors and quantum tubes to protect said components from overheating. The losslessness of kinetic energy afforded by the coolant's superfluidity means that it can continue to circulate around the component for a much longer time before needing to be recycled. This has led to such components lifetimes being greatly increased.</t>
 <t id="2904">Helium Refinery</t>
 <t id="3001">Plasma Conductors</t>
 <t id="3002">These conductors are designed to allow the flow of plasma through a component at the greatest possible efficiency. Though made relatively cheap to produce through years of research and development, plasma conductors remain highly complex pieces of technology. They are used primarily in the construction of weapon and shield components. </t>
 <t id="3004">Plasma Conductor Factory</t>
 <t id="3101">Quantum Tubes</t>
 <t id="3102">An example of complex technology being made cheap through years of continuous research, no one outside of those manufacturing the technology quite knows how quantum tubes work. Though the outer wiring itself it easy to make and understand, the internal structure and what the wiring actually carries must be constructed only by those with countless hours of study and examination under their belts; otherwise risking catastrophic failures that can lead to entire shutdowns of the equipment in which they are used.</t>
 <t id="3104">Quantum Tube Factory</t>
 <t id="3201">Refined Metals</t>
 <t id="3202">Refined from ore found in countless asteroids across the Jump Gate network, these refined metals are cheap to produce and easy to reinforce, making them perfect for use in constructing all kinds of Hull Parts, not just for ships and stations, but also for smaller components that used across all of space.</t>
 <t id="3204">Ore Refinery</t>
 <t id="3301">Scanning Arrays</t>
 <t id="3302">Scanning arrays have seen elegant redesign over the years so that ships and stations do not risk fragile antennas being broken or destroyed by collisions. Now entirely internal systems, scanning arrays are used not just in ship and station scanners and radars, but are also used in the targeting systems supplied with turret and drone components. </t>
 <t id="3304">Scanning Array Factory</t>
 <t id="3401">Shield Components</t>
 <t id="3402">From generators to coils that maintain energy over time, shield components are a wide arrange of technologies that provide everything necessary to build a variety of shields. Completely modular, each part can be used in each shield, which has led to a wide variety of new-generation shields being produced in recent years. As with all ship equipment, shields are built on-demand, and so shield components are produced in factories and shipped straight to shipyards and equipment docks where they can be more freely used for construction and repair.</t>
 <t id="3404">Shield Component Factory</t>
 <t id="3501">Silicon</t>
 <t id="3502">Silicon, required for the production of the most common types of silicon wafers, is usually mined or harvested from asteroids or other uninhabited celestial bodies.</t>
 <t id="3504">Silicon Mine</t>
 <t id="3601">Silicon Wafers</t>
 <t id="3602">If a technology requires any kind of chip, it is highly lightly that is uses silicon wafers. Light, efficient and cheap to produce, these wafers are usually layered or constructed in hexagonal meshes to allow for quick transfer of data across a component.</t>
 <t id="3604">Silicon Refinery</t>
 <t id="3701">Smart Chips</t>
 <t id="3702">A specialised form of microchip that contains a small amount of heuristic programming, these chips cannot allow a system to learn, but can allow for small, snap intelligent decision-making that assists in targeting systems and makes autonomous piloting more accurate. These chips are primarily used in guided missiles and drones.</t>
 <t id="3704">Smart Chip Factory</t>
 <t id="3801">Soja Beans</t>
 <t id="3802">A small bean grown all across Paranid space, the soja bean add flavour and nutritional value to the soja husk; the Paranids' primary food source. While this is its primary purpose, on many Paranid colonies it is also dried and ground into a powder and mixed with water, creating a flavoured and healthy drink that provides Paranid with ample energy.</t>
 <t id="3804">Soja Bean Farm</t>
 <t id="3901">Soja Husk</t>
 <t id="3902">A Paranid dish; soja beans that have been crushed into a paste and mixed with the flesh of the maja snail, then served in a maja snail shell, soja husk is accepted as both a tasteful and nutritious meal by the Paranid, though there are few non-Paranid who have dared try it.</t>
 <t id="3904">Soja Husk Factory</t>
 <t id="4001">Spacefuel</t>
 <t id="4002">Spacefuel is made from processing and distilling wheat, water and a blend of spices. It is a cheap but strong alcoholic beverage that has been made illegal to trade in bulk across the Jump Gate network in an attempt to avoid drunken accidents on both ships and stations. In order to sell spacefuel as a beverage, one must be a licenced bar owner.</t>
 <t id="4004">Spacefuel Factory</t>
 <t id="4101">Spaceweed</t>
 <t id="4102">While seen as part of every-day life in Teladi society, spaceweed has been made illegal in both Argon and Paranid space, as it is seen as a dangerous narcotic. This point is argued heavily by many of those who partake in the drug, which is usually dried, crushed and then smoked, but attempts to legalise it have as of yet failed.</t>

 <t id="4201">Spices</t>
 <t id="4202">Spices are used in many food and pharmaceutical products; primarily as an agent to add extra flavour, but also sometimes due to other properties that some are known to have, ranging from acting as a relaxant to a mild hallucinogenic. Factories that legally produce spices are commonly inspected to make sure their produce is in line with the local law, but as they are often shipped as a mixture, it is sometimes difficult to keep an eye on which spice is being used for which purpose.</t>
 <t id="4204">Spice Farm</t>
 <t id="4301">Sunrise Flowers</t>
 <t id="4302">Known to grow naturally only on Ianamus Zura, the Teladi mastered the art of bio-engineering a near-identical but still artificially grown sunrise flower long ago. When squeezed, the leaves of the sunrise flower produce a bitter-tasting oil that while despised by other species, the Teladi appreciate as an adequate food source.</t>
 <t id="4304">Sunrise Flower Farm</t>
 <t id="4401">Swamp Plant</t>
 <t id="4402">Cultivated in a warm and humid environment, swamp plant is a small moss-like plant known to have mildly narcotic properties; the reason it is dried and crushed to be used as space weed. Though it is widely known that swamp plant is the main ingredient of a drug made illegal throughout non-Teladi space, producing and trading it itself is not illegal, as it is only in the processing of the plant that the narcotic properties can be unlocked.</t>
 <t id="4404">Swamp Plant Farm</t>
 <t id="4501">Teladianium</t>
 <t id="4502">Teladianium is a hard, tough material used by the Teladi for station and, more commonly, ship construction. A lighter compound than the refined metals used in other races' vessels, Teladianium is traditionally made from chemically treated Teladian mud. However, as the necessary chemicals are rarely found in space, and expensive to produce, the Teladi often replace them with the raw minerals found in asteroids.</t>
 <t id="4504">Teladianium Foundry</t>
 <t id="4601">Turret Components</t>
 <t id="4602">After the unification of the design process in station and capital ship weapon systems, many different turrets can be built from different configurations of these turret components.</t>
 <t id="4604">Turret Component Factory</t>
 <t id="4701">Water</t>
 <t id="4702">Essential to all known biological life forms, water has never become much of a catalyst for dispute amongst species, owing to its ubiquity in space. It is being used somewhere in the manufacturing process of nearly all goods available across space; especially, however, in the production of edible goods.</t>
 <t id="4704">Ice Refinery</t>
 <t id="4801">Weapon Components</t>
 <t id="4802">Made up from such things as trigger and reloading mechanisms, chambers and barrels, weapon components make up the mechanical part of all ship weapons. Combined with specialised advanced electronics, a number of different weapons can be made from the modular components, also across different size ranges. Shipped to shipyards and equipment docks as a single package, these components can then be put together relatively quickly and easily to make any weapon for the final customer on-demand.</t>
 <t id="4804">Weapon Component Factory</t>
 <t id="4901">Wheat</t>
 <t id="4902">A staple ingredient in food rations, wheat is grown across all of Argon space and consumed on a daily basis in the form of flatbread or bunyos. Where meat is still produced from Argnu, instead of synthesised or cloned, wheat is also fed to the animals, which results in meat of exceptional quality. </t>

 <t id="10101">Decryption Module</t>
 <t id="10102">A decryption module is a chip containing a series of decryption algorithms that can be used to bypass most computer firewalls. Though not much use on its own, it is the most important part of both the Defence and Security Decryption Systems, which makes it a vital and highly sought-after tool.</t>

 <t id="10202">Available in many topics, digital seminars are perhaps the most comfortable way to learn on the go, making them very popular with learned experts and budding students alike. Sourced from many databases and universities across the Jump Gate network, a digital seminar allows you to learn a great deal about a given topic while not interrupting your daily routine. This has made them particularly popular in corporations where training is necessary but time is short.</t>

 <t id="11001">Hacker Chips</t>
 <t id="11002">A highly specialized form of microchip that contains a wide variety of electronic decryption and hijacking algorithms, hacker chips are, of course, illegal across the Jump Gate network, and if you are caught with them on your person, you will immediately be reported to the authorities.</t>
 <t id="11101">Interface Unit</t>
 <t id="11102">This interface unit is essentially an intelligent signal converter designed to allow different pieces of equipment, developed by different species and using a variety of technologies, to communicate. It has numerous input and output ports, and has a learning mode to allow it to determine the correct signals to use.</t>
 <t id="11201">Majaglit</t>
 <t id="11202">Majaglit is a type of jewelry seen as the mark of high-society by many Paranid. It is forged, usually, from the superheated shell of a maja snail, that is then crushed and heated again until it forms a glass-like liquid that when cooled will harden into whichever shape the artist has formed.</t>
 <t id="11301">Security Decryption System</t>
 <t id="11302">Security decryption systems are beloved on the black market as the catch-all approach to circumventing or controlling computer and electronic systems. With heuristic algorithms and enough storage to save very few successful and failed hacking attempts, the security decryption system is capable of learning from its past mistakes and changing its approach until it is able to break the system. Experts have confirmed that these systems are not AGI, but that they do come worryingly close.</t>
 <t id="11401">Spacefly Eggs</t>
 <t id="11402">Laid by spaceflies in the latter stages of their development, spacefly eggs have long been collected, particularly by the Split, for many uses, among them to be turned into spacefly caviar or to be frozen and turned into jewelry. With spaceflies becoming rarer in recent years, the price of their eggs has recently skyrocketed.</t>
 <t id="11501">Spacefly Caviar</t>
 <t id="11502">A delicacy among the Split and enjoyed by other races also, spacefly caviar is made from collected spacefly eggs and preservatives, stored in airtight containers and often enjoyed with alcoholic beverages. Due to the modern rarity of the spacefly, this caviar is harder to produce and more difficult to come by, and recently its price has begun to rise.</t>
 <t id="11601">Kyon Crystal</t>
 <t id="11602">Used in the manufacture of Kha'ak beam weapons before the Jump Gate shutdown, many of these crystals were salvaged from wrecked Kha'ak ships during the Kha'ak War and Operation Final Fury, and so have been carried across the Jump Gate network or handed down over the generations. There are reports of it being found naturally occurring in some asteroids across the current Jump Gate network configuration, but so rarely is it found that these reports are yet to be confirmed.</t>
 <t id="11901">Explosives</t>
 <t id="11902">Though nothing compared to the force of a ship weapon or missile, these explosives are still capable of tearing open a small area of hull or rapidly dismantling a small building, if enough are used. Of course, such a weapon is considered illegal across most of the Jump Gate network, but that does not stop them being traded quite frequently on the black market.</t>
 <t id="12001">Secure Container</t>
 <t id="12002">A vacuum-sealed container that required a six-digit code both to open and shut. These containers do not have the same integrity as a ship container, but as long as they are not tampered with, will securely hold whatever is placed inside for a considerable time.</t>
 <t id="12101">Magnet</t>
 <t id="12102">A magnet will quickly and securely fasten to any magnetic compound, which includes many metals and semi-metals. On trying to unfasten the magnet, some amount of resistance will be met.</t>
 <t id="12201">Spacesuit Bomb</t>
 <t id="12202">Small enough to be launched from a hand-held weapon or similar, these explosives will stick to any magnetic surface and await to be triggered by the user. If positioned correctly, they can be used to destroy small parts of station and ship hull plating, but the user must be quite close for this to work, otherwise the bomb is likely to float away from its target before its magnet takes hold. Warning: Explosives can kill.</t>
 <t id="12301">Spacesuit EMP</t>
 <t id="12302">A device that when triggered will cause a small electro-magnetic explosion without doing noticeable structural damage, this EMP is small enough to be fired from a hand-held weapon. It requires a precise aim to be most affective, as the pulse will only cripple very nearby computer and electronic systems. </t>
 <t id="12401">Remote Detonator</t>
 <t id="12402">A remote detonator can be attached to most explosives in order to ensure that they only go off when the user wishes, minimising the risk of accidental or pre-emptive detonations.</t>
 <t id="12501">Bandannite Crystal</t>
 <t id="12502">First collected by an explorer from an asteroid in Ore Belt, Bandannite was named after the legendary Ban Danna, an Argon military commander and war hero before the Jump Gate shutdown. Rediscovered across the entire Jump Gate network after the realignment, this crystal is not the rarest, but will still fetch a good sum at the right dealer.</t>
 <t id="12601">Menelaene Crystal</t>
 <t id="12602">A crystal discovered at the heart of an asteroid in Kingdom End, Menelaene is named after the then princess of the Queendom of Boron, Menelaus. Many a miner have since found this rare crystal in asteroids scattered throughout space, and though many simply sell the crystals for a profit, some choose to hold onto the precious stone, in the hope that the Boron may one day re-emerge from the darkness.</t>
 <t id="12701">Aguilite Crystal</t>
 <t id="12702">Discovered by Ichirou Aguilar, a Terran mercenary trapped in the Jump Gate network after the Sol Gate was destroyed, this crystal is not found so commonly, but is also not so rare that its price on the free market is deemed ludicrous.</t>
 <t id="12801">Mitonene Crystal</t>
 <t id="12802">Named after the famed Boron scientist, Mi Ton, mitonene is rarely found among asteroids, at least in the current configuration of the Jump Gate network, therefore fetching a good price at most free market traders.</t>
 <t id="12901">Burnite Crystal</t>
 <t id="12902">Though the pilot who first discovered this crystal wished to remain anonymous, and the reasons for its mysterious name are not known, it is confirmed to be one of the rarest precious stones currently to be found in the Jump Gate network. Traders and collectors will pay almost any price for it, giving a strong incentive for explorers to search asteroid fields closely for such a prize.</t>

 <t id="16601">Damaged Singularity Engine</t>
 <t id="16602">The damaged remains of this particular Singularity Engine are in a better condition than most. Unlike most examples found to date, the core has not melted and it might be possible to get it working again with the right components. It's definitely going to need a new flux capacitor, however.</t>
 <t id="16701">Programmable Field Array</t>
 <t id="16702">Engineers developing new forms of spatial fields normally start out using a programmable field array. This allows them to modify the size, shape and composition of the field, but at a much lower power output than would normally be available in a final production model.</t>
 <t id="16801">Flux Capacitor</t>
 <t id="16802">The flux capacitor itself is a very old piece of technology, but for a long time it was little more than a curiosity with no viable practical application outside the laboratory. This changed with the development of the Singularity Engine, but since the other technologies used in this engine were a closely-guarded secret, now lost, flux capacitors are no longer in production.</t>

 <t id="17401">SETA</t>
 <t id="17402">The Singularity Engine Time Accelerator, or SETA, has fallen out of common use in recent times, as the necessary components required to build the device were lost or destroyed during the Jump Gate shutdown. If a pilot is able to find one of these lost singularity engines, however, it may be possible to build a personal device that functions similarly to the old-style ship attachment, compressing time around the attached spacesuit and deactivating with any major interference to the spacesuit's stability. No known side effects of using SETA exist, but they cannot be ruled out.</t>
 <t id="17501">BoFu Nugget</t>
 <t id="17502">BoFu meals are known to be very nutritious and healthy. The Boron love them and it is common for a single nugget of BoFu to last many days.</t>
 <t id="20000">(*CONSUMABLE WARES*)</t>
 <t id="20101">Tracker Mine</t>
 <t id="20102">Tracker Mines are deadly devices that have two phases of operation. In the detection phase, the mine detects a valid target within outer detection range and initiates a limited manoeuvre to intercept the target. When it is deemed close enough to trigger, the second detection phase sees the mine's explosive payload detonate. Tracker Mines are less effective at chasing fast and agile targets, but can be incredibly dangerous when used in number or against larger and less agile targets.</t>
 <t id="20201">Mine</t>
 <t id="20202">Mines are a commonly-used static combat tool that explode and cause massive hull damage under a number of circumstances. Some explode on contact, some when a target comes within a certain range. Some even track their targets and can be programmed to recognise friend from foe.</t>
 <t id="20301">Satellite</t>
 <t id="20302">A static object used for observation, once deployed a satellite will pick up any communications sent and received by both ships and stations on open frequencies within a certain range. They are not one-use objects; a satellite can be deployed in one location, then deactivated and picked back up in a ship, then redeployed in a new location.</t>
 <t id="20401">Advanced Satellite</t>
 <t id="20402">{20201,20302}</t>
 <t id="20501">Laser Tower Mk1</t>
 <t id="20502">Deployed from a compartment of a ship, the laser tower is a static combat unit used primarily in the defence of an area of objective. They use a simple targeting system to turn towards the enemy before firing. Though laser towers can target and hit small ships, they are most effective at medium range against medium or larger targets.</t>
 <t id="20601">Laser Tower Mk2</t>
 <t id="20602">{20201,20502}</t>
 <t id="20701">Resource Probe</t>
 <t id="20702">Often fired from scout and mining ships deep within a mineral or gas region, resource probes are able to scan both asteroids and gas clouds in order to analyse what elements make up the region, in order to give miners a better idea of what they can find there. Not only can a resource probe discover the different elements making up the field, but also give a rough estimate on its yield.</t>
 <t id="20801">Nav Beacon</t>
 <t id="20802">Nav beacons remain the last and best ally of the lost pilot. Once deployed, the beacon will emit a light strong enough to cut through even the thickest nebula, and at a frequency that can be seldom missed. They are often dropped strategically throughout dangerous parts of space, to designate a safe route, or intermittently in heavy nebulas to guarantee that even the worst pilot has a chance of finding their way back home.</t>
 <t id="20901">Friend/Foe Mine</t>
 <t id="20902">Friend/Foe Mines are equipped with specialist software that allows the user to program the mine not to respond to friendly targets. This is usually achieved over comm-frequency identification, and friendly targets must stay informed of changes to the frequency as not to accidentally fall foul of the mine's dangerous payload - this in of itself is almost always an automated process.</t>
 <t id="30000">(* Unique Mod Parts *)</t>
 <t id="30001">Basic Weapon Chamber</t>
 <t id="30002">Though not all weapons, in fact very few, use projectile bullets in the modern day, most still have the equivalent to a chamber, where the shot that will be fired is either loaded or prepared. It is then from the chamber that the bullet is fired. As weapons are now built on-demand, and very few pilots have reason to dismantle them, it is uncommon to find detached weapon chamber. However, if one can be found, it may be possible to modify an existing weapon in a way hitherto unthought of.</t>

 <t id="30301">Basic Engine Fuel Injector</t>
 <t id="30302">Though ship engines no longer require liquid fuel, if it can be safely added to the mixture that powers the engine, it may well be possible to improve engine properties. This requires a fuel injector, not used in ship engines since liquid fuel was a requirement. As they have now fallen out of use, many pilots have simply thrown them away or scrapped them for parts, and so they may be difficult to come across.</t>

 <t id="30601">Basic Ship Nanoweave</t>
 <t id="30602">Though today, shipyards across the Jump Gate network are trusted to construct ship hulls from blueprints using hull parts constructed from metals or metal-equivalents, it is rumoured that during the Terran conflict, Beryl developed nanoweaves capable of mimicking or adjusting ship hulls in very specific ways. If these nanoweaves can be found, and understood, it may well be possible to use them to tweak properties of existing ships to make improvements.</t>

 <t id="30901">Basic Shield Generator Coil</t>
 <t id="30902">As with all equipment attached to ships in the modern age, ship shields are built on-demand. This means that all shield components are shipped together directly to the shipyards and equipment docks that build and repair ships, and as most pilots are satisfied with what they are given, it is very uncommon to find individual components on their own. If, however, one can find a shield generator coil, it may be possible to modify an existing shield in such a way that the properties can be improved.</t>

 <t id="40002">Whether it be a rock or metal, or something man-made, these objects when exposed to specific elements will cause a short but strong and surprising explosion that can be used for a variety of purposes.</t>
 <t id="40101">Tuning Software</t>
 <t id="40102">While modifying hardware can take you very far improving a variety of equipment, tuning software can also be used to make improvements to the equipment's algorithms and calculations. This may unlock extra potential in the hardware; overriding limits placed on the systems by manufacturers, or simply optimising existing software in such a way that equipment can be used for efficiently.</t>
 <t id="40201">Nividium Oxide</t>
 <t id="40202">Nividium oxide is an unstable mixture that when mistreated can be both deadly and messy. When treated properly, however, and handled with care, it becomes a sure-fire, controlled way to produce extra energy in the form of force and excess heat. Racers across the Jump Gate network like to refer to the chemical as 'nox'.</t>
 <t id="40301">Extended Fuel Container</t>
 <t id="40302">Though it has now been a while since ship engines required liquid fuel to function, these fuel containers can still be found throughout the Jump Gate network, often used to contain something completely different, and sometimes used by modders in engine modifications.</t>
 <t id="40401">Nividium Crystallite</t>
 <t id="40402">Though a metal in its natural form, under the right conditions, nividium can become a light and strong crystalline structure. Though there are not many uses for this compound, it is rumoured that, among other things, some ship pilots use it and rare ship nanoweaves to improve properties of their ship hulls.</t>

 <t id="102">The descendents of Terran colonists stranded from Earth centuries ago, the Argon became their own thriving civilisation covering a great many systems and forging relations with several alien races. Throughout their short history the Argon Federation has been plagued by war, notably with the Xenon. Their greatest challenge however came from the unlikely source of the reconnected Terrans of Earth where they were plunged into the costly Terran Conflict.</t>

 <t id="302">The aggressive Split live in a society constantly changing leadership where challenging factions rise up to impose a new Patriarch. Their short temper and fiery disposition puts them at odds with other races which has sometimes lead to war, notably with the Boron and Argon.</t>
 <t id="303">SPL</t>
 <t id="401">Paranid</t>
 <t id="402">The physically imposing Paranid are often regarded as arrogant by several races which usually stems from their exceptional mathematic skills and religious fervour. Allied with the Split and distrusting of the Argon, the Paranid have been in several conflicts where they use their technological prowess and multilevel thinking to gain tactical advantages.</t>
 <t id="403">PAR</t>
 <t id="501">Teladi</t>
 <t id="502">The lizard-like Teladi are one of the founding members of the Community of Planets and have a natural affinity towards business and the accumulation of profit. They enjoy favourable relations with other races although some find their drive for profit disconcerting. Their long lifespan gives them a unique view of the Jump Gate shutdown, as does their previous experience being cut off from their home system of Ianamus Zura.</t>
 <t id="503">TEL</t>
 <t id="601">Xenon</t>
 <t id="602">The Xenon are a mechanical race resulting from past Terran terraformer ships which eventually evolved intelligence. A constant threat in many areas of the galaxy, it is thought that the Jump Gate shutdown may stem their movements but given their disregard of time it is possible they may simply travel between stars. The Xenon have no known allies and communication with them is often relegated to folklore.</t>
 <t id="603">XEN</t>
 <t id="701">Terran</t>
 <t id="702">The Terrans of the Solar System have a long history of spaceflight and exploring the Jump Gate network. After the events of the Terraformers over Earth, the Terrans severed their contact with the rest of the galaxy and had several centuries of rebuilding and advancement in isolation. Their brief return led to the Terran Conflict which preceded the mass disconnection of Jump Gates. It is unknown if the war precipitated this event.</t>
 <t id="703">TER</t>
 <t id="801">Drone</t>
 <t id="802">Drones are designed to specialise in a narrow field of tasks. With AI research outlawed to avoid a similar situation to the Terraformer-Xenon evolution, drones are limited in scope and capability. However, results from Xenon research have led to advancements in drone technology, something which troubled many experts.</t>
 <t id="803">DRN</t>
 <t id="901">Kha'ak</t>
 <t id="902">Thought to have been wiped out during Operation Final Fury, very little is known about the Kha'ak other than they seem to be an insectile hive race hell-bent on the destruction of all those that share the Jump Gate network. As a hive race, it is suspected that individual intelligence gives way to a communal or caste mentality, but very little research into the species was completed before Operation Final Fury took place.</t>

 <t id="1001">Arrival of USC X and Kyle Brennan</t>
 <t id="1002">No one would have imagined that at the peak of Xenon activity in the Community of Planets, in 742 NT, a ship from Earth would arrive in Seizewell, a star system controlled by the Teladi Company, using a functioning jump drive.\n\nThough there was much ado about the Terran pilot and his extraordinary ship, Kyle William Brennan quickly proved his mettle by volunteering to aid in the Second Xenon Conflict, using the Terran technology equipped on the USC X, which far outstripped anything available in the Community of Planets, to cripple the Xenon central supply and power facilities. For his feat, Brennan was named "The Hero of the Xenon Conflict".</t>
 <t id="1011">A New Threat Emerges</t>
 <t id="1012">Years after Kyle Brennan's heroism, his son through Ninu Gardna was arrested for ties to the Yaki Syndicate. Though Julian Gardna-Brennan chose rehabilitation over imprisonment, his chance for true redemption came weeks later as the Argon colony of President's End was laid to waste by a fleet of unknown alien spaceships, later named the Kha'ak after a Split folk-tale.\n\nThe Kha'ak were relentless in their assaults, striking all across the Jump Gate network. The offensive could only be stopped by Julian and his close friends, Saya Kho and Brett Serra, who chased the Kha'ak to Omicron Lyrae, where they were using Julian's father to unwillingly control an M0-class battleship.\n\nJulian was able to rescue his father, and halt the Kha'ak assault on the system, but only at the cost of Brett Serra's life.</t>
 <t id="1021">The Race To Find Earth</t>
 <t id="1022">After the Battle of Omicron Lyrae, Kyle Brennan's desperate search for Earth became a staple of public opinion for many months. There were even those who believed his story and followed in his footsteps. These few included Ion, a Goner, who asked Julian Brennan for his assistance in claiming Kha'ak technology to build a new Jump Gate to Earth.\n\nWith the task completed, Kyle - still with an active connection to the Kha'ak hive - accidentally lead the Kha'ak directly to the Gate, and then to Earth itself. If the Kha'ak expected a swift victory in Sol, however, they were denied it, as the far superior USC fleet, greatly improved since their disconnect from the Jump Gate network, awaited them.</t>
 <t id="1031">First Contact with the Paranid</t>
 <t id="1032">In the wake of the Terraformer Conflict that had seen the Argon separated from their Terran roots, paranoia was so rife among them that peaceful negotiation between them and the first alien species they encountered was difficult to induce.\n\nFirst identified by the Argon as Xenomorphs, then as Xenon \(before the word was irrevocably connected with the descendants of the Terraformer fleet\), tentative diplomatic talks with the Paranid began in 130 NT, after years of small skirmishes wherein both races had refused to identify themselves.\n\nProgress was slow, with neither race trusting the other, but eventually trade and information exchanges were negotiated that benefited the Argon and Paranid both technologically and culturally.</t>
 <t id="1041">Foundation of the Federation</t>
 <t id="1042">Building themselves up from nothing after facing complete annihilation by the Terraformers in the Terraformer Conflict, the Argon spread throughout the Jump Gate network at a far slower rate than the original Terran settlers.\n\nDuring this time, there were of course many disagreements over the direction of the Argon people, leading to the secession of both the Hatikvah Free League \(original\) and Free State of Solara from Argon Prime leadership. Despite their differences, however, they were able to join in an alliance, and in 241 NT the covenant creating the Argon Federation, with Argon Prime as its capital, was signed.</t>
 <t id="1051">First Contact with the Boron</t>
 <t id="1052">It was nearly two hundred years after first contact between the Argon and Paranid, in 323 NT, that first contact with the Queendom of Boron was made. The Boron were very open to treaty negotiations, and it was a mere four months after first contact that trade and cultural accords were signed between Argon Prime and Kingdom End, the Boron home system. These accords formed a strong basis for Argon-Boron relations that have lasted ever since; the foundation upon which a close friendship between the two races was built.\n\nThe Paranid, less trusting than the Argon, refused to sign treaties so quickly with a race with whom they had had so little contact.</t>
 <t id="1061">The Boron Campaign</t>
 <t id="1062">The peace that all three of the Argon, Paranid and Boron had known for a year after the Argon-Boron treaties were signed was suddenly shattered when the Queendom was attacked by a fleet of unknown ships accompanied by a flotilla of Paranid ships. The Boron were only able to survive the conflict with the help of the Argon, who were furious with the Paranid because of their sudden aggression.\n\nThe Split, to whom the ships of unknown design had belonged, quickly made themselves known as an aggressive and war-hungry people who wished to challenge themselves against all, and for a number of years, small skirmishes with the Split were known to occur both in Boron and Argon space.</t>
 <t id="1071">The Community of Planets</t>
 <t id="1072">In an effort to avoid further violence between the Argon, Boron, Paranid and Split, the Community of Planets was founded in 328 NT, pledging to work together in all things and against all threats in unity. Attempts were at first unsuccessful, with only the Argon and the Boron joining the Community in a so-named "Guild of Founders". The Paranid and Split, respective relations with the Argon and Boron still in ruin, refused to join, instead making their own alliance.</t>
 <t id="1081">200 Years of Cold War</t>
 <t id="1082">Following the initial and somewhat failed founding of the Community of Planets, there were years of cold war between the Argon and the Boron, and the Paranid and the Split. Though all races saw moderate economic growth and technological achievement, it was fuelled predominantly by the necessity to be ready for war.\n\nThis cold-war state was finally broken in 489 NT when the Paranid, after much long and difficult diplomacy, agreed to join the Community of Planets. Though for another twenty-five years the Split Patriarchy stubbornly believed they could stand alone, they too were brought into the fold, in 514 NT, when the second formal founding of the Community of Planets was completed.</t>
 <t id="1091">First Contact with the Teladi</t>
 <t id="1092">Contact with another species calling itself the Teladi was made in 550 NT. Ostensibly searching for their lost home, Ianamus Zura, the newcomers proved themselves shrewd business people with the uncanny ability to make the best of even the worst situation. Their introverted nature and ubiquitous tendency towards avarice proved uncomfortable to other races, but their financial brilliance all but assured them a place within the Community of Planets.\n\nSuch was their dominance over other races in business and economic fields that the Teladi quickly became the primary financial power within the Community, even introducing the Credit as a Community-wide currency to great success.</t>
 <t id="1101">The Terraformer Project Begins</t>
 <t id="1102">In the wake of the USCSS Winterblossom's discovery of an entirely empty, alien Jump Gate network, there were immediate and numerous calls for a colonisation programme.\n\nWhile rendering planets suitable for human habitation was possible with then modern Terran technology, it was still slow and arduous. Instead of sending human crews out for decades to complete this task, fleets of intelligent robot vessels, Terraformers, were designed and built to complete it with speed, efficiency and far less risk.\n\nOver the course of thirty years from 2066 AD, the First, Second and Third Terraformer Fleets were sent out into the network to terraform a dozen planets inside their stars' biospheres.</t>
 <t id="1111">The Terraformer Conflict</t>
 <t id="1112">In 2145 \(-25 NT\), fleets of mutated, long-forgotten Terraformer ships, thought destroyed by the safe self-destruct command issued forty-six years prior, appeared in orbit around Earth, their terraforming tools turned into weapons of war as billions died in the ensuing firefight around Sol. The USC was caught unprepared, with few ships and minimal crews on each. The war put all previous conflicts to shade.\n\nIn 2146, the crew of the USCSS Dragonfyre, Nathan Ridley Gunne, Poul Vantera and Frank de Vries, lured the Terraformer away from Earth, through a Jump Gate connected to the larger, alien network stumbled upon by the USCSS Winterblossom. As the Terraformer fleet followed the USC fleet away, Gunne ordered the Dragonfyre to destroy the Gate to Sol, closing the system off to the network for hundreds of years.\n\nEarth was saved, but across the network the Terraformer War raged on. Many Terran colonies were razed before the ever-dwindling USC fleet could bring the machines to book.</t>
 <t id="1121">Evolution of the Xenon</t>
 <t id="1122">It is unknown how many Terraformers ignored or survived the safe self-destruct order issued by the USC in 2099 AD, though it is suspected that most that did were part of the Second Fleet that was furthest away when the order was given.\n\nOver the years since, the word Xenomorph, and then Xenon, has been intrinsically connected to the self-controlled and seemingly intelligent machines that have plagued not just the Argon, but all members of the Community of Planets. If, as rumoured, they are the descendants of these Second Fleet Terraformers, then any hint of their objective to create beautiful Earth-like worlds is gone, replaced by an almost obsessive vendetta to annihilate all sentient, biological life.</t>
 <t id="1131">Relations with the Terrans Begin to Cool</t>
 <t id="1132">After their assistance in dealing with the major Kha'ak offensives at the end of the Kha'ak conflict, the Community of Planets was eager for Sol to join its ranks. The Government of Earth and the Outer Solar System \(GEOSS\), the system-wide government of Sol, was willing to undertake a loose alliance with their long-lost cousins, the Argon Federation, alone, but declined the offer to join the Community.\n\nOther races were hurt by what they saw as a slight against them, and relations slowly began to cool off, but the Jump Gate network once again knew peace, for a short while.</t>
 <t id="1141">Tensions Build over AGI Usage</t>
 <t id="1142">In the centuries since Nathan R. Gunne destroyed the Jump Gate leading to Sol, Terrans had fostered a deep distrust of any and all artificial intelligence, something that, despite the threat posed by the Xenon, had not been mirrored by the Community of Planets.\n\nThe Terrans made it quite clear that they would not allow their mass-produced ships to be artificial intelligently-controlled, nor would they allow artificial intelligently-controlled ships to enter their space. Additionally, they bid the Community to allow computer-controlled ships to be inspected by the AGI Task Force for any potentially dangerous intelligent systems. The Community of Planets refused.\n\nStrictly determined that AGI never again become a threat to Sol, the Terran government ordered the USC and ATF to fly into Argon space.</t>
 <t id="1151">The Terran Conflict</t>
 <t id="1152">The Community of Planets was quick to see the Terran fleet moving through Argon space as an act of aggression, and reacted accordingly. War fell onto the Jump Gate network once again, and thousands more were killed as the Community came to realise just how advanced Terran technology was in comparison to their own.\n\nThere was no hope of the Argon Federation being able to defeat the USC in a direct confrontation. Instead, they drew on Terraformer technology developed in secret by the Beryll; new CPU ships and assembler drones were built, with new Jump Gates also built to maintain supply lines.</t>
 <t id="1161">The Destruction of the Torus Aeternal</t>
 <t id="1162">Saya Kho, serving for some time as an Argon Secret Service agent on Earth, feared greatly that the Terran Conflict would lead to the defeat of her beloved Argon Prime. In the absence of sound alternatives, she was forced to take extreme measures.\n\nShe and Sherman Hiatu, an Argon double agent stationed in the Sol system,  devised a plan to destroy Earth's last line of defence, the Torus Aeternal, coordinating with the Federal and Beryll fleets to strike the planet as soon as the space station had been removed.\n\nIn 778 NT, they put their plan into action. They initiated an emergency procedure known as segment-separation. Torus Aeternal would separate into its constituent 420 segments that drifted into a higher orbit, hereby irrevocably destroying the Torus. Although the number of casualties was low because the segments sealed themselves to act as lifeboats, some individuals in the connecting elements were killed, among them Saya Kho and Sherman Hiatu. Neither body was ever found.</t>
 <t id="1171">The Flight of the Winterblossom</t>
 <t id="1172">With a connection to the vast alien Jump Gate network established in 2042 AD, the scientific community of Earth and the USC worked together to build Earth's first interstellar ship. The entire population of Earth was swept up in an unprecedented level of star-fever and the project took place under immense pressure, but three years after its construction began, in 2046 AD, the USCSS Winterblossom, captained by René Farnham, was ready to face the stars.\n\nAfter a two-year journey through the Jump Gate network, the Winterblossom returned to Earth with results suggesting hundreds, possibly thousands of star systems. However, there was no trace of the Gates' builders, or any other intelligent life. Humanity, it seemed then, was alone.</t>
 <t id="1181">Warp Instability</t>
 <t id="1182">First in -24 NT, connections between all Jump Gates, including those made by Earth, were unexpectedly severed, and then, just as surprisingly, re-established. Terran scouts were the first to realise that the network now had different configuration than before the disconnect.\n\nThen, starting during the Terran Conflict, the Jump Gates once again began to destabilise, with Jump Gates opening and closing, first sporadically and then on an almost daily basis before, in 782 NT once again shutting down completely.\n\nTheorists suggest that these shutdowns line up with extreme rises in the aggression of the Xenon, or other artificial intelligence threats, and question whether it may be an attempt to slow the destruction of intelligent biological life.</t>
 <t id="1191">The Jump Gate Shutdown</t>
 <t id="1192">When in 782 NT the Jump Gate network was suddenly disconnected, as every single active Gate suddenly deactivated without warning, the universe was thrown into chaos. Scores of star systems that depended on resources coming in from other territories were thrown into anarchy and war as, in their panic, people fought for survival. Diplomatic relationships and alliances that had stood the test of time were altogether destroyed. The fate of many star systems, and many people, is yet to be uncovered. The Community of Planets, after 268 years, ceased to exist.</t>
 <t id="1201">The Alliance of the Word</t>
 <t id="1202">In 801 NT, nineteen years after the death of the Community of Planets, messenger drones from Sacred Relic appeared in Argon Prime and Kingdom End, bringing word from the Paranid that they were attempting to find out the reason for the shutdown and send any aid they could. These Paranid called themselves the Alliance of the Word, offering some kind of communication between star systems, even if interstellar travel was no longer possible.\n\nThe Alliance of the Word still operates in Sacred Relic to this day, sending automated scouts to systems still trapped outside the newly connected Jump Gate network, in the hope that they may find out who has survived the dark times, and send aid to them if necessary.</t>
 <t id="1211">The President's End Massacre</t>
 <t id="1212">The Argon colony of President's End had no military ships and a minimal security force when unknown alien ships jumped into the system with the use of fully-functional jump drives. There was barely time to breathe before these same ships opened fire on station and ship alike, tearing the small colony apart in under an hour, jumping away before the nearest Federal fleet could respond.\n\nThe Split would go on to name this new threat the Kha'ak, after a folk-tale told to scare children, and the Community of Planets would fight a bitter fight against them for a number of years. President's End never recovered from this onslaught, with ships and stations left to rust where they had been annihilated by the Kha'aks' deadly kyon beam weapons.</t>
 <t id="1221">The Battle of Omicron Lyrae</t>
 <t id="1222">The most famous battle of the Kha'ak campaign, the Battle for Omicron Lyrae saw Community hero Kyle Brennan unwillingly used to control a devastating Kha'ak M0 battleship, with weapons larger and more terrifying than anything ever seen by the Community of Planets.\n\nOnly the intervention of Julian Brennan, Saya Kho and Bret Serra, all named Heroes of the Community of Planets for their efforts, stopped the M0 from destroying the heavily colonized planet of Omicron Lyrae, rescuing Kyle from the clutches of the Kha'ak. While Julian and Saya went on to play important roles in the finding of Earth and the Terran Conflict respectively, Bret was killed in the attempt to rescue Kyle and save the system.</t>
 <t id="1231">Operation: Final Fury</t>
 <t id="1232">Though the M0-class battleship used by the Kha'ak at the Battle of Omicron Lyrae was destroyed, and no more were seen during the rest of the Kha'ak campaign, the Kha'ak remained a dangerous threat to the Community of Planets for some time. The tide only turned against them when a connection to the Sol Gate was re-established, and the technologically advanced USC fleet were able to stifle the last major Kha'ak offensive.\n\nAfter that, the Community of Planets was able to organize a counter-attack against the Kha'ak, using information gathered from Kha'ak ships to locate the hive's point of origin and destroy it. This operation was known as Operation: Final Fury and is seen as the end of the Kha'ak campaign.</t>
 <t id="1241">The Gates Reopen</t>
 <t id="1242">Though it is impossible to know when the first of the thousands of Jump Gates throughout the universe reopened, or which it was, the first instance recorded by the Alliance of the Word of a reopening was in 803 NT, reconnecting Sacred Relic to Pious Mists \(then an unexplored system\). Messenger drones they had sent to nearby systems soon returned with more news of open Gates.\n\nFor near to twenty years Jump Gates continued to open and close much as they had before 782 NT, some sporadically opening, closing and reopening to a new location, some turning on and immediately stabilising.</t>
 <t id="1251">The Gate Network Stabilises</t>
 <t id="1252">In the twenty years after first reports of reopened Jump Gates arrived in Sacred Relic, the Alliance of the Word continued to study Jump Gates and as many unstable warp anomalies as they could for any pattern or reasoning behind the instability of the system.\n\nThough they were unable to garner much, they were able to find a noticeable pattern. As time passed, more and more Gates were not only remaining open, but also stable. By 820 NT, they had gathered enough data to be able to confirm publicly that the new Jump Gate network was completely safe to traverse.</t>
 <t id="1261">Earth Scientists Create Jump Gates</t>
 <t id="1262">In 2022 AD \(-148 NT\) Ashizava Kazuko made a startling discovery: it was indeed possible to travel faster than the speed of light with finite energy. Kazuko had successfully established the principle of the tunnel-jump.\n\nScepticism was rife, but repeated experiments showed that the previously unknown student was indeed correct. Very soon, two huge Jump Gates were built; one sent to Mars and the other to Proxima Centauri, in humankind's first attempt at interstellar travel.\n\nIn 2041, contact with the ship carrying the Proxima Gate was lost, but after a year of frantic research, the Sol Gate once again found a connection. Scientists were stunned to discover that it had not connected with the Proxima Gate, but an unknown Gate in a distant region of the Milky Way.\n\nUtterly by chance, humankind had stumbled across an entire network of Jump Gates of unknown origin. It was an invitation that could not be turned down.</t>
 <t id="1271">The Terraformer Project is Terminated</t>
 <t id="1272">The use of artificially intelligent ships to help in Earth's colonisation efforts sent shockwaves across the scientific community. Many argued the move would drastically accelerate the terraforming process without incurring the resultant increase in construction costs, and it was undeniable that there were huge economic and social benefits to humankind. Others questioned whether the use of truly intelligent machines was in fact slavery. Many were drawn into countless arguments over the definition of sentience.\n\nThe Terraformer Project's condemnation though, came in the form of mathematicians and programmers that proved without a doubt that goal drift - changes made to the original programming of the Terraformers caused by machine evolution - could not be ruled out. This, they argued, was a profound danger to intelligent life throughout the galaxy.\n\nIn 2099 AD, the World Government ordered that a safe self-destruct program be patched into the First, Second and Third Terraformer Fleets' software, causing the immediate destruction of all Terraformer units.</t>

 <t id="101">System</t>
 <t id="102">Systems</t>
 <t id="103">A System represents a vast area of space, typically a single solar system. Systems, sometimes known as 'clusters' contain smaller areas called Sectors. Sectors are joined within a System by Superhighways while travel between their containing Systems is via Jump Gates.</t>
 <t id="201">Sector</t>
 <t id="202">Sectors</t>
 <t id="203">Sectors are large areas of interest within a single System. They contain smaller areas of interest called Zones which are all connected within the Sector by Local Highways. The containing Sectors are connected by Superhighways.</t>
 <t id="301">Zone</t>
 <t id="302">Zones</t>
 <t id="303">Zones are points of interest within a single Sector. Zones are connected through the Local Highway system but not all Zones are directly connected by the same Local Highway to all other Zones in the same Sector.</t>
 <t id="401">Highway</t>
 <t id="402">Highways</t>
 <t id="403">Highways were first created by JSDD before the shut down of the Jump Gates. Their purpose is to allow bearable travel times through and between Sectors.</t>
 <t id="501">Local Highway</t>
 <t id="502">Local Highways</t>
 <t id="503">Local Highways are unidirectional paths of accelerated traffic used to connect areas of interest, called Zones, within a Sector and reduce travel time. As they operate at lower speeds than the Superhighways, it is fairly safe to enter or leave the Local Highway at any time. Local Highways have opened up fast and convenient mass-traffic and trading lanes between and within Zones.</t>
 <t id="601">Superhighway</t>
 <t id="602">Superhighways</t>
 <t id="603">Superhighways connect Sectors within the same System. They operate at highly accelerated speeds so leaving them during transit is not possible. They have opened up inter-sector travel to commercial mass-traffic without the need for stasis chambers or unwanted aging effects on travellers.</t>
 <t id="701">Jump Gate</t>
 <t id="702">Jump Gates</t>
 <t id="703">The mysterious Jump Gates were supposedly created by a race which most species refer to as the Ancients. These devices are apparently spread throughout the entire galaxy and possibly beyond. They provide the only feasible and effective method of travel between Systems at this time. Unfortunately, most if not all became non-operational at the event known as the 'Shutdown of the Gates'.</t>
 <t id="801">Asteroid</t>
 <t id="802">Asteroids</t>
 <t id="803">Usually the remnants from astronomical body formation or the result of collisions and meteor strikes, asteroids of all sorts of sizes provide sources of several recoverable minerals and crystals. Whilst many asteroids only contain basic common ores and minerals, others may be the source of rarer and far more profitable materials. A space miner's life is usually fairly monotonous, but there can be moments of excitement and elation.</t>
 <t id="901">Galaxy</t>
 <t id="902">Galaxies</t>
 <t id="903">The Galaxy, when used to refer to the local Galaxy or 'the Known Galaxy', is a loose term for the collection of Systems currently considered as surveyed and mapped by the known sentient life-forms. Intergalactic travel is not currently thought possible by any known life-form.</t>

 <t id="101">Albion Skunk</t>
 <t id="102">This multi-purpose craft was conceived by Argon Shipwrights as a long range reconnaissance ship for use within the Terran Solar System. It is unknown how many of these ships exist but some have been sold to major corporations as personal command ships for high-ranking executives.</t>
 <t id="201">TF/X Utility Craft</t>
 <t id="202">The TF/X Utility Craft \('TF/X' standing for 'Terraformer/Xenon'\) is a class of vessels with highly speculative purposes. One thing is obvious, though: The local TF/Xenon tech-pool \(short for 'technological gene pool'\) is currently evolving on a biological seeming trajectory; although it is doubtful that actual biological components are used in construction of the TUC, the general consensus among TF/Xenon experts is that biological features are quickly being emulated by the machines wherever sensible.</t>
 <t id="301">Boarding Pod</t>
 <t id="302">The method of choice when attempting to take of an enemy ship is the Boarding Pod. Equipped with highly professional marines that is. Boarding Pods pierce through a ship's hull as if it were butter.</t>
 <t id="401">Traitor ROV</t>
 <t id="402">The Traitor is an ROV/URV \(Remotely Operated Vehicle/Unmanned Ranging Vehicle\), a drone primarily used for stealth deployments of limpet mines. While not capable of high acceleration, it is still reasonably agile, and can cause critical damage to stations and capital ships, when not detected before mine deployment. Depending on the territory, possession of the Traitor ROV may be illegal, and thus, it is not seen in frequent use. Incidentally, it is more often than not put to use by criminal organisations.</t>
 <t id="501">Trojan ROV</t>
 <t id="502">The Trojan, while still an ROV/URV \(Remotely Operated Vehicle/Unmanned Ranging Vehicle\), is equipped with an extensive array of tool-level AGI, also called 'AGI on a chip', more commonly known as 'Hacker Chips'. The Trojan is capable of manipulating on-board computer systems and other electronic components, rendering them temporarily or permanently unusable, or tricking them into undesirable behaviour. An example of an especially undesirable system behaviour, at least from the proprietor's standpoint, is to trigger the emergency shutdown of attached storage modules; many systems will drop their cargo into space to save it from an imminent explosion - which will never occur. The system that was manipulated by the Trojan will usually recover when its error detection mechanisms initiate a cold reboot sequence.</t>
 <t id="601">Assassin ROV</t>
 <t id="602">The Assassin ROV is an extremely agile ROV/URV \(Remotely Operated Vehicle/Unmanned Ranging Vehicle\) with an excellent thrust-to-mass ratio, giving it unparalleled acceleration capabilities. It can track and take down even the fastest and most agile targets - but it needs an extremely skilled operator to achieve consistently good results. Owing to its low mass, the Assassin's primary weapon is comparatively weak; this, however, poses no problem in typical mission scenarios, where fast moving objects with fragile shielding are targeted.</t>
 <t id="701">{29101,703} {29106,101}</t>
 <t id="702">Similar to the Trojan, the Beholder ROV/URV is equipped with 'AGI on a Chip', commonly known as 'Hacker Chip', and an extensive array of various VLSI scanning devices. It is capable of detecting and decoding wired and wireless information streams, and can also carry out virtually undetectable man-in-the-middle network attacks. A built-in mass resonance coherer gives the Beholder ROV the ability to deduce astonishingly detailed structural information from inside target objects. Owing to the fact that mass resonance coherers work best in absence of large masses like ships or stations, the results collected by the Beholder ROV are usually richer in information, and more reliable than those yielded by typical on-board systems.</t>

 <t id="1002">Belonging to a group of autonomously operating URVs \(Unmanned Ranging Vehicles\) that is in widespread use across all sectors today, the Interceptor URV is controlled by a simple AI. On the positive side, it is very agile and has a high thrust-to-mass ratio; on the negative side, it has a comparatively fragile hull and weak primary weapons. However, since the Interceptor URV is usually deployed in swarms \(also known as 'shoals'\), its destructive force is still substantial.</t>
 <t id="1003">Interceptor URV</t>
 <t id="1101">{29101,1003} {29106,201}</t>

 <t id="1201">{29101,1203} {29106,101}</t>
 <t id="1202">The Intrepid URV is basically a reinforced version of the Interceptor URV, trading in some of the Interceptor's agility and thrust-to-mass ratio for a less fragile hull, and a slightly better primary weapon. Controlled by AI and usually launched in swarms \(or 'shoals'\), the Intrepid URV can cause considerable damage to vessels and installations. The Intrepid URV is customized for military operation, and as such, not usually available on non-military vessels.</t>

 <t id="1401">{29101,1403} {29106,101}</t>
 <t id="1402">The Overrun URV is a drone with an average agility and thrust-to-mass ratio; what makes it extremely dangerous to capital ships and even large stations, however, is its capability to launch Newtonian V Crushers. If not taken down within seconds of detection using appropriate countermeasures, a swarm/shoal of Overrun URVs will inevitably break through any kind of plate shielding and armour, rendering the target disabled in nearly all cases. Overrun URVs, when used in STG \(space-to-ground\) operation, are usually decisive for the outcome of the battle, and are utterly destructive. Hence, STG operation with this type of weapon is outlawed across all sectors.</t>

 <t id="1601">{29101,1603} {29106,101}</t>
 <t id="1602">Like many other drone types, the Surface Miner URV is most effective when deployed in large swarms. It features grapplers capable of collecting comparatively small pieces of raw materials \(mostly ores, but also crystals, Nividium, ice and others\); it has, however, no mechanism for drilling into the surface of celestial objects, hence its name, Surface Miner.</t>

 <t id="1703">{29101,1603}</t>
 <t id="1801">Cargolifter URV</t>
 <t id="1802">One of the most common drones seen in day-to-day business across all sectors is the Cargolifter URV. Autonomously controlled by a very basic AI, Cargolifter URVs are responsible for loading and unloading of ships and stations, or transferring goods between them. Usually equipped with strong reaction thrusters capable of short acceleration peaks, Cargolifter URVs show increased fuel consumption when transporting large masses quickly. This, naturally, is expected system behaviour and poses no operational challenge.</t>
 <t id="1901">Assault URV</t>
 <t id="1902">Only a few specialized capital ships have the necessary infrastructure to carry Assault URVs, but when they do, it makes them very potent against stationary targets like stations. Once deployed these URVs move to their target and deliver their deadly freight while their host ship stays out of the target's range.</t>
 <t id="2001">Construction URV</t>
 <t id="2002">The Construction URV enables its host to quickly reconstruct severely damaged or even destroyed individual parts such as turrets. It is also capable of building ships and stations if remotely controlled by a Shipyard or Construction Vessel, but it cannot be used to build a free-floating structure autonomously. That's a conscious design limitation to prevent these AGI-supported URVs from building independent structures.</t>
 <t id="2101">Talorcan</t>
 <t id="2102">With its basic layout unchanged for more than two decades, the Talorcan has seen only minor technical revisions since its introduction by JSDD. Originally intended as an escort vessel for diplomatic missions, the Albion Energy Subsidiary acquired the design plans for this type of vessel to serve on a number of different tasks. Though still used as an escort for larger ships, it's frequently sent on scouting and reconnaissance missions, used for scientific observations, and at times, as a means of fast transportation for high ranking officials of the firm.</t>
 <t id="2201">Nechtan</t>
 <t id="2202">Although considerably larger than its sibling and just as agile, the Nechtan does not improve much on tactical capability when compared to the Artio. A saying amongst BA pilots states that, although it looks like a fighter, 'the Nechtan can run, but it can never fight'.  This is only partially true, as was proven in the 'Split Blitz' operation following the 'Split Downtime', where three Nechtans alone managed to incapacitate a Carrier \(but were, unfortunately, destroyed shortly after this remarkable and unexpected victory\).</t>
 <t id="2301">Hesus</t>
 <t id="2302">This is a solid no-nonsense ship that is mainly used for missions of high importance, e.g. escorting the Head of State on interplanetary diplomatic journeys. Its high manoeuvrability and powerful engines give it an edge over many other vessels of its class. When one or more Hesus are observed within a sector, it is immediately known that an important political event must be taking place shortly somewhere nearby. Because of this, the Hesus is commonly known as a harbinger of peace - or of war.</t>
 <t id="2401">Birog</t>
 <t id="2402">The Birog is, as some say, 'good for avoiding a fight'. Although capable of reasonable acceleration and with acceptable manoeuvrability, its standard weapon system is too weak to be of practical use in any serious combat situation. The Birog is therefore mainly used as an escort ship, or as a guard of honour at the arrival of foreign dignitaries.</t>
 <t id="2501">Bonescout</t>
 <t id="2502">Named after the vessel of late Cho t'Nnt, a folk hero amongst virtually all Split, this class of ship is small and fast but, due to its very weak weaponry, nearly useless in combat. Only the fierce determination of its Split pilots, many of whom have used the Bonescout in kamikaze attacks, can turn this small craft into a formidable weapon.</t>
 <t id="2601">M</t>
 <t id="2602">The M/BRANCH9, commonly referred to just as M, is a Xenon fighter patrolling the outskirts of machine territory. Although the intentions of the machines are generally unknowable, the M's sub-par engine and, for a fighter, weak weapon systems seem to suggest that this fighter is not meant to be thrown into full battle. There were, however, at least two separate incidents in which the Xenon sent large numbers of this craft into combat, probably because other options were unavailable to them at the time. Operating in large numbers, the M was able to turn the table in favour of the machines on both events despite its shortcomings.</t>
 <t id="2701">N</t>
 <t id="2702">The N/BRANCH9 is another patrol ship in service with the Xenon. Commonly known as N, this vessel can't be held up against most other fighters with its average agility and below average weapon systems. The Xenon, however, are quite capable and willing to throw hundreds or thousands of Ns into a battle, if necessary. Just as with the other ships employed by the machines, it is not known where its production facilities are located; this is a secret all non-machine factions would like to see exposed.</t>
 <t id="2801">{29101,2803} {29106,2101}</t>
 <t id="2802">Designed and manufactured by Gigurum Heavy Launchers, the Gigurum Container Transporter is specifically designed to carry containers, as is easily discernible by its distinctive arrangement of storage modules. This freighter is neither fast nor agile, and it is completely unarmed. It has, however, become the standard mode of transportation for containers throughout all sectors.</t>
 <t id="2803">Gigurum</t>
 <t id="3001">{29101,2803} {29106,2001}</t>
 <t id="3002">Designed and manufactured by Gigurum Heavy Launchers, the Gigurum Bulk Transporter is designed to transport bulk goods cut and packaged into distinctive storage modules of specified dimensions. With its line of freighters, Gigurum have brought the concept of bulk ware to its logical extremes. At first, there was plenty of resistance against the very restricted formats of goods that could be transported. Over time, however, the concept proved extremely efficient and became the preferred method of transportation for all kinds of bulk goods across the sectors. The Gigurum Bulk Transporter is not fast, and not at all agile, and is completely unarmed. It has, however, become indispensible in today's world of effective and cheap bulk good transportation.</t>
 <t id="3003">{29101,2803}</t>
 <t id="3101">{29101,2803} {29106,2201}</t>
 <t id="3102">Designed and manufactured by Gigurum Heavy Launchers, the Gigurum Energy Transporter is specifically designed to carry energy-loaded goods. Since chemical and/or nuclear energy cells can pose dangers to populations and ecosystems, this type of heavy freighter must be licensed for the transportation of hazardous materials; it also has to undergo regular technical inspection to keep the licence. Piloting this type of ship needs a special licence on the part of the pilot. The Gigurum Energy Transporter is neither fast nor agile, and is completely unarmed.</t>
 <t id="3103">{29101,2803}</t>
 <t id="3201">{29101,2803} {29106,2301}</t>
 <t id="3202">Designed and manufactured by Gigurum Heavy Launchers, the Gigurum Liquid Transporter is specifically designed to carry goods in their liquid state of aggregation. Freighters of this type need an official technical clearance if they are used to ship hazardous liquids and their pilots need a license. The Gigurum Liquid Transporter's distinctive storage modules make it easily discernible even from a distance. This ship is neither fast nor agile, and is completely unarmed.</t>
 <t id="3203">{29101,2803}</t>
 <t id="3301">Escape Pod</t>
 <t id="3302">The Escape Pod is the best choice when the heat of battle approaches face melting temperatures. Whereas it cannot guarantee the user's safety, most manufacturers claim it to provide an at least 10% higher survival rate of pilots who have them built into their ships and a 99% survival rate for those who actually use them - manufacturers also usually add that these numbers refer to the first couple of seconds after using the pod as they have no control over further hostilities towards the pilot after leaving his ship.</t>
 <t id="3701">Skull Crusher</t>
 <t id="3702">As with many ships used today by Family Ryak, the Skull Crusher \(often referred to as 'Scorpion' by the Argon Military\), is an ancient piece of technology bolted together from scrap parts using spit and good faith. Due to its superiority back when first introduced before the Fall Of The Gates, this ship, when maintained properly, can be held up to even some modern fighters. It has reasonably responsive main thrusters giving it good acceleration but is somewhat lacking in manoeuvrability. Its armament is average at best but here, just as with the Bonescout, Split determination makes up for material shortcomings.</t>
 <t id="3801">Hermod</t>
 <t id="3802">The Hermod is a freighter employed by the Republic of Cantera. According to its construction design, its sole purpose is the transport of goods in their liquid state of aggregation. It is poor in both acceleration and deceleration and its manoeuvrability is equally poor. It has just a token weapon of no tactical value. Its only real means of defence, therefore, is the unimportance of the Republic of Cantera.</t>
 <t id="3901">Balor</t>
 <t id="3902">The Balor is a relatively modern frigate built by the contractor Albionmetals. It is small and agile due to its responsive and powerful main engine and attitude thrusters. Although its weapons systems are regarded as average compared to other frigates, they are still quite formidable for a ship that small. The Balor has an elaborate ejection mechanism that can deliver torpedoes to within a meter's range of the projected target area from as far as a half light-second away. The vessel is capable of performing complex missions on its own, specialising in the delivery of torpedoes.</t>
 <t id="4001">Construction Vessel</t>
 <t id="4002">The Construction Vessel \(CV\) carries all the parts necessary to build a single station. Once it has arrived at its location, it will build parts of that station out of its own components, meaning it is good for only a single use. Any wares bought by the CV before the build order has been given will be placed in locked storage containers that will not open again until construction begins. This means that the CV cannot be used to sell wares.</t>
 <t id="4101">Arawn</t>
 <t id="4102">One of the largest ships currently in service by any known faction, the Arawn is a highly advanced carrier, designed and first launched from Argon Prime. Its extensive weapons array - including plasma and particle weapons, as well as multi-purpose drones - gives it an edge in all tactical situations.</t>
 <t id="4201">Taranis</t>
 <t id="4202">When the Plutarch Mining Corporation \(PMC\) first released this type of destroyer into service, there weren't many other ships in its class that could compete with the Taranis' massive armoury and powerful turrets. Even though regarded as slightly clumsy by some with respect to manoeuvrability, this classic destroyer is a heavy-hitter - 'flies like a brick, kills like a blade' is a common saying among combat pilots that have flown the Taranis. Although mainly used for sector patrol along highly disputed borders or other such areas, this ship is no stranger to battle. It has great tactical value and has been copied by other manufacturers.</t>
 <t id="4301">Titurel</t>
 <t id="4302">Not much is known about this powerful armed-Freighter, except that it appears to be beyond the manufacturing capabilities of the Reivers themselves. Experts assume that the Reivers have a limited number of these ships which they have maintained over the decades since the Fall of the Gates. To the present day, the Titurel's origin remains a mystery that many factions would like to see solved.</t>
 <t id="4401">Scaldis</t>
 <t id="4402">The Scaldis is a freighter designed upon a so called 'Common Ground' layout \(a multi-species common property platform established by the Alliance of the Word\), and manufactured by several contractors across all known sectors. It has weak engines and no real combat-worthy weapon, but it still remains popular due to its great cost-benefit factor.</t>
 <t id="4501">Defence Grid URV</t>
 <t id="4502">The Defence Grid URV \(DGURV\) connects to a 'wall' of other DGURV to form a protective distributed barrier. It is commonly used to protect sensitive targets from attacks in otherwise inconvenient angles as well as to force enemy fighter squadrons to fly around it while providing safe haven to damaged or fragile craft in the heat of battle.</t>
 <t id="4601">Shield Support URV</t>
 <t id="4602">The Shield Support URV actively regenerates shield deficits of its parent ship by transferring power directly into its shield matrix, circumventing the limitations of the principal generator's energy-couplings. In order for the URV to do its work it must know the exact shield modulation frequencies so as to not damage the shield but instead infuse it with its own power. Conversely there have been experiments researching possibilities for them to instead damage an enemy shield but so far their effectiveness at this task has not bore the kind of fruit one would expect from an efficient offensive weapon.</t>
 <t id="4801">Sucellus</t>
 <t id="4802">While the Sucellus rarely sees serious combat, it has come to be seen as a symbol of security for the Canteran people. One of the better maintained relics of the Terran era, this ship usually patrols close to stations to keep up a strong visual presence to both the Canterans and Reivers. The Sucellus' acceleration is average, and its agility is severely hindered by its sub-par attitude thrusters. Despite all of this, pilots who have flown this ship for some time usually come to love it for its reliability.</t>
 <t id="4901">Gangrene Chaser</t>
 <t id="4902">Formerly classified as Raptor by Argon forces, the actual name of this class of vessel, when translated back from the Split language, makes one wish not to have translated it in the first place - 'Gangrene Chaser' is about as unpicturesque as it gets with the Split. Technically, this craft has not been overhauled in more than a decade and thus is no match for modern destroyers.</t>
 <t id="5001">{29101,5003} {29106,101}</t>
 <t id="5002">The Scoop Collector URV is a close relative to the Surface Miner; large swarms of this type of drone are being deployed into gaseous nebulae simultaneously to collect raw gasses. The method by which the gas collection is accomplished is called 'scooping'; hence, the name Scoop Collector. Autonomously controlled by AI \(or AGI in some rare models\), the Scoop Collector URV is the foundation on which many branches of industrial production are relying. Be it hydrogen, anti-H, oxygen or more exotic gases, chances are, swarms of Scoop Collectors stand at the beginning of the refinement process.</t>

 <t id="5201">Drostan</t>
 <t id="5202">This ship is neither agile nor fast and needs to be protected at all times. However, it features sophisticated torpedo launchers and, for all intents and purposes, constitutes a bomber. It is mainly used against ground installations but can as well attack and swiftly destroy large orbital complexes. During the Fourth Xenon Uprising \(which later came to be known as the 'IRQ4 conflict'\), several Drostan class bombers laid waste to two off-ecliptic Xenon power stations. All of the Drostan returned, with not a single casualty. The Drostan is an important tactical asset.</t>
 <t id="5301">Consumer Compact Craft</t>
 <t id="5302">Consumer Compact Crafts, better known as CCCs, come in many different shapes and configurations. Ranging from slow boats, used for the occasional family trip, to passenger vehicles and fast courier ships, CCCs are the most common class of small spacecraft across all sectors. While targeted at the consumer market and the private customer, CCCs are the spacecraft of choice for most smaller businesses and commercial operations. Curiously, most species have their own Consumer Compact Craft layout, although generally, all CCCs adhere to similar basic design patterns.</t>
 <t id="5401">Bulk Carrier</t>
 <t id="5402">Like all mass-traffic vessels, Bulk Carriers \(or BCs\) come in different shapes, configurations and layouts. Depending on the intended purpose, BCs can be outfitted with either a more powerful engine, larger container bays, or both. The most common Bulk Carrier design is licensed from Gigurum Heavy Launchers by several manufacturers; it can even be configured for a water-breathing Boron crew. Bulk Carriers are the spacecraft of choice for all businesses dealing in transportation of goods; they are an extremely common sight across all sectors.</t>
 <t id="5501">Maintenance &amp; Engineering Craft</t>
 <t id="5502">Maintenance &amp; Engineering Crafts are the primary workhorses in all construction environments. They are mainly deployed at the building sites of large-scale space engineering projects like stations, inside of wharfs, and at orbital accelerator waypoints. Depending on the particular application, MECs are also used to carry out servicing and maintenance of stations and capital ships. Their wide range of available options makes them equally suitable for difficult rescue operations, when, for example, wreckage must be disassembled and disposed of.</t>
 <t id="5601">Traffic &amp; Riot Control Craft</t>
 <t id="5602">Used by practically nobody else but armed police forces, the Traffic &amp; Riot Control Craft is the primary vehicle deployed for mass-traffic regulation in transit lanes. It is, however, also in broad use for many other police operations, which is why its base configuration includes an, albeit weak, assault weapon. Other applications for this type of craft include sector patrol, crowd control, special operations, and citizen intelligence \(also known as pro-active neighbourhood surveillance\).</t>
 <t id="5701">Industrial Surveillance Craft</t>
 <t id="5702">A small subset of vessels supplemental to official police crafts, the Industrial Surveillance Crafts \(or ISCs\) are on private patrolling duty near industrial manufacturing compounds, wharfs, and large installations. Their range of missions is limited to surveillance only; in case illegal activities are detected, the observing ISC must call the authorities and remain in surveillance position. Thus, since Industrial Surveillance Crafts are not expected to participate in any kind of combat, their on-board weapon system is nothing more than a token weapon.</t>
 <t id="5801">Crew &amp; Equipment Carrier</t>
 <t id="5802">Supplemental to the Traffic &amp; Riot Control Craft, the Crew &amp; Equipment Carrier \(CEC\) is the heavy lifter of the police forces. It is used in all situations where police forces and swat teams need to be flown into possible riot or combat zones. It is also frequently used to relocate prisoners, and as well to transport heavy gear and equipment into the area of police operations.</t>
 <t id="5901">Vasio</t>
 <t id="5902">As with most vessels employed by the Albion Energy Subsidiary, the Vasio is no exception in that its design had been acquired from Jonferson Space Dynamics Division \(JSDD\) shortly before the Fall of the Gates. Unlike other AES ships, however, it has since received a major technical overhaul, especially with regards to its weapon systems.  The Vasio's good manoeuvrability and potent weapons make it a natural choice for important escort missions.</t>
 <t id="6001">Artio</t>
 <t id="6002">This unique ship undeniably looks like a pimped-up hovercraft - only that it's not. Designed by Beryll Astrotech - the successor organisation of the then illegal Beryll hi-tech syndicate - the Artio builds on technology gleaned from Terraformer artefacts, like much of the machinery and ships manufactured by Beryll Astrotech. The Artio has only a 'token weapon' which makes it basically unfit for combat. However, with its highly responsive main and attitude thrusters, this little craft is extremely well suited for covert operations near or between orbital installations.</t>
 <t id="6101">Light Sul</t>
 <t id="6102">The Light Sul is, by all measures and standards, pretty average for a carrier. The reason for its obvious shortcomings can be found in the limited budget available to the PMC advisory board during the design phase of this ship. The reason for the then low budget was the uncertaintly on how the resources of Albion would support a stranded population and their infrastructure. With PMC now dominant, the Light Sul continues to play a major role in consolidating their position of power.</t>
 <t id="6201">Heavy Sul</t>
 <t id="6202">Significantly larger than the Light Sul, the Heavy Sul has also improved on armament over its older sibling. While manoeuvrability may not be essential for a carrier, good acceleration certainly is. Regrettably, the Heavy Sul does not deliver in this regard either; sometimes, it is thus mockingly called 'Lazy Sul' by friendly and enemy combatants alike. The PMC military advisory board actively prosecutes occurrences of this sort of slander, as it is perceived as eroding crew morale.</t>
 <t id="6401">Veteran Arawn</t>
 <t id="6402">A modified version of the first-generation 'Arawn', the Veteran Arawn is a very capable command-ship. Once meticulously maintained by ex-military engineers, Heart of Albion decided to convert this symbol of the Federation into a ship able to project their influence across the whole Albion system. Plutarch Mining Corporation expresses caution whenever a Veteran Arawn enters their space, usually ending in excessive military posturing. Heart of Albion captains are instructed not to respond in kind.</t>
 <t id="6501">Fedhelm</t>
 <t id="6502">The Fedhelm is an all-in-one mining solution for ores of all kind. It is capable of launching mining drones, but has no on-board processing facility. It is not agile or fast, nor is it equipped with a tactical weapon system.</t>
 <t id="6901">Sequana</t>
 <t id="6902">The Sequana is an all-in-one mining solution for liquids in their solid state of aggregation \(ice\). It is capable of launching mining drones, but has no on-board processing facility. It is not agile or fast, nor is it equipped with a tactical weapon system.</t>
 <t id="7001">Midir</t>
 <t id="7002">First designed and released by TerraCorp, this ship is now in production by a number of manufacturers across all sectors, most notably, Albionmetals. It is a ions &amp; plasma mining vessel that has seen many revisions since its initial introduction; its basic parameters, however, remain unchanged. Although capable of launching mining drones, the thrust-to-payload ratio of the Midir is very low, and so is its manoeuvrability. Its weapon systems are not intended for tactical use - as can be expected from a commercial mining vessel.</t>
 <t id="7101">K</t>
 <t id="7102">Descendant from the original Terraformers released by Earth about a millennium ago, the Xenon underwent many waves of machine evolution. Mechano-taxonometrists are fairly certain that the line of TF/Xenon present in the known sectors today belong to the ninth diversification branch \(of roughly 27\). The K/BRANCH9 - commonly referred to as just K - is a large destroyer with decent manoeuvrability and an above average weapons system.</t>
 <t id="7201">Boann</t>
 <t id="7202">First designed and released by TerraCorp, this ship is now in production by a number of manufacturers across all sectors, most notably, Albionmetals. It is a hydrogen mining vessel that has seen many revisions since its initial introduction; its basic parameters, however, remain unchanged. Although capable of launching mining drones, the thrust-to-payload ratio of the Boann is low, and so is its manoeuvrability. Its weapon systems are not intended for tactical use - as can be expected from a commercial mining vessel.</t>
 <t id="8601">Dwalin</t>
 <t id="8602">The Dwalin is a basic mining vessel designed to launch mining drones harvesting metal ores but it is also equipped with a mining/drilling laser. It has no on-board ore processing facility. Its thrust-to-payload ratio is low as is its manoeuvrability. Like most commercial craft the Dwalin is unarmed.</t>
 <t id="8701">Golem</t>
 <t id="8702">Being under development for many years, the Golem has only recently been released into active duty. Built upon advanced technology obviously gleaned from as-yet unknown sources, it is speculated, and widely accepted, that this ship must have been a co-development between PMC and Beryll Astrotech. Featuring an impressive thrust-to-payload ratio for a vessel of this size, its manoeuvrability is equally astonishing considering the sheer mass involved. Just as notable is the handsome array of weapons; it can pick a fight anytime without hesitation. All round, the Golem does not repeat the design flaws seen in other PMC productions but is instead one of the finest ships bribery can obtain.</t>
 <t id="8801">Moebius</t>
 <t id="8802">The Moebius, apparently, is a smaller version of the Golem and, as such, shares much of its splendid technology. Generally what can be said about its larger sibling is also true with regard to the Moebius. Its manoeuvrability and thrust-to-payload ratio are each one of a kind, leading this class of ship, and its handsome weapon array outshines similar ships with ease. It is, however, not clear how PMC - a company better known for crude mining operations than the design of elegant and powerful warships - was able to acquire the Moebius' design plans. One thing is clear to experts: PMC could not have it done it all by themselves.</t>
 <t id="8901">Lepton</t>
 <t id="8902">Like most vessels in service with the Republic of Cantera, the Lepton does not quite size up with other ships of its class. This freighter has somewhat outdated hydrogen-fusion main thrusters allowing only moderate acceleration and manoeuvrability. Its token weapon is not worth mentioning.</t>
 <t id="9001">Hymir</t>
 <t id="9002">The Hymir is a basic mining vessel designed to launch mining drones for harvesting liquids or gasses in their solid state of aggregation \(ice\), but it is also equipped with a mining/drilling laser. Its thrust-to-payload ratio is low, as is its manoeuvrability. Like most commercial craft, the Hymir is unarmed.</t>
 <t id="9101">Betaver</t>
 <t id="9102">The Betaver is a basic mining vessel designed to launch mining drones for harvesting materials in their ionized and plasma-like states of aggregation. Its thrust-to-payload ratio is low, as is its manoeuvrability. Like most commercial craft, the Betaver is unarmed.</t>
 <t id="9201">Hayabusa</t>
 <t id="9202">The Hayabusa is the most commonly-observed fighter within the confines of the Republic of Cantera. Initially a small mining survey ship, the Hayabusa was retrofitted to a combat role to defend against the Reivers. The Hayabusa has good acceleration for a ship its size, while its manoeuvrability is only average. Its weapon systems are at best described as weak. Just like the Daito, the Hayabusa is a good choice for day-to-day patrolling duties but is only second-best when it comes to combat.</t>
 <t id="9301">Nudung</t>
 <t id="9302">The Nudung is a basic mining vessel designed to launch mining drones for harvesting matter in a gas-like state of aggregation; it is mostly used to harvest hydrogen or other light technical gases. Its thrust-to-payload ratio is low, as is its manoeuvrability. Like most commercial craft, the Nudung is unarmed.</t>
 <t id="9401">Orlam</t>
 <t id="9402">Ledda Industrial, another spin-off of the now-disbanded Jonferson Space Dynamics Division, manufactures this fast ship to custom order. Powered by M-AM/AM-M conversion technology, this otherwise pretty unremarkable craft derives a small advantage in range from its engine system. The Orlam's tactical use is very limited. It is, however, 'nice to look at' as pilots across sectors mockingly note. It is mainly used for low-priority escort missions.</t>
 <t id="9501">Ossian</t>
 <t id="9502">Originally intended as a fast courier ship, the Ossian is mainly used these days as an escort on diplomatic missions of very low priority, or on scouting missions when the success of the task at hand may depend on manoeuvrability and speed. The tactical capabilities of the Ossian are severely limited by its for all intents and purposes nonexistent offensive weaponry. This fighter is sometimes called 'the tin can' or, more poignantly, 'the death trap'; the latter refers to the fact that during the last half decade more pilots have died in this ship alone than in all other similarly sized crafts of all factions put together. Most of those deaths occurred outside of combat.</t>
 <t id="10001">{29101,10003} {29106,1001}</t>
 <t id="10002">The Camulos Raider is a fighter craft featuring better-than-average acceleration and manoeuvrability, as well as good or average weapon systems. As with all vessels manufactured by Jonferson Space Systems, this ship is based on two-way antimatter conversion technology \(M-AM/AM-M\). When Jonferson Space Dynamics Division \(JSDD\) disbanded right after the Fall of the Gates, several of the firm's subsidiaries located in different sectors continued operations on their own. Jonferson Space Systems is the largest of them. Common to all subsidiaries was JSDD's head start in M-AM/AM-M conversion. Despite many efforts of competitors to reverse-engineer or just steal it, this innovation \(called a 'tech miracle' by some\) has remained firmly with the JSDD subsidiaries.</t>
 <t id="10003">Camulos</t>
 <t id="10101">{29101,10003} {29106,1101}</t>
 <t id="10102">Based on advanced M-AM/AM-M conversion, as are most vessels manufactured by JSS, the Camulos Vanguard is similar to its sibling the Camulos Raider except that it trades-off better armament for acceleration capabilities. The Camulos Vanguard is one of the stronger escort ships and often used on missions it wasn't originally intended for. Its tactical capabilities are notoriously underestimated.</t>
 <t id="10103">{29101,10003}</t>
 <t id="10201">{29101,10003} {29106,1201}</t>
 <t id="10202">Similar to both the Camulos Raider and the Camulos Vanguard, the Camulos Sentinel is easily one of the best-armed fighters of the JSS fleet. Surprisingly, trading off acceleration and manoeuvrability for the mass of a large dumbfire missile arsenal does not take the edge off this infamous ship; the opposite is the case. With its additional potent energy weapon array, the Camulos Sentinel has proven an invaluable asset during many a battle. Its role in the Fourth Xenon Uprising \(also known as 'IRQ4 conflict'\) cannot be overstated.</t>
 <t id="10203">{29101,10003}</t>
 <t id="10301">{29101,10303} {29106,1001}</t>
 <t id="10302">Although similar in appearance to the Camulos Raider, the Foltor Raider's technological design philosophy follows a completely different path. While the Camulos Raider, like its cousins, is based on JSS's proprietary M-AM/AM-M conversion technology, the Foltor Raider achieves similar results by its exceedingly efficient use of more conventional technology. Equipped with only an average array of weapons, the Foltor Raider's heavy thrusters nevertheless generate enough thrust to compete with much smaller vessels.  Owing to the fast response of its attitude jets, the Foltor Raider is surprisingly agile for a ship of its size.</t>
 <t id="10303">Foltor</t>
 <t id="10401">{29101,10303} {29106,1101}</t>
 <t id="10402">The Foltor Vanguard is often regarded as the big brother of the Foltor Raider. Similar in design, the Foltor Vanguard features an impressive array of weapons for a ship its size but is slightly lacking in its manoeuvrability. It is mainly used as a sector patrol ship but has occasionally been deployed in heavy combat situations.</t>
 <t id="10403">{29101,10303}</t>
 <t id="10501">{29101,10303} {29106,1201}</t>
 <t id="10502">Another sibling of the Foltor family, the Foltor Sentinel has also been designed from ground up for the sole use by the Argon Military. As the newest addition to its class, the Foltor Sentinel features energy weapons only, but no missiles. Many regard this as a design flaw, while actually, the trade-off in total mass provides for better acceleration and attitude control than otherwise would have been possible.</t>

 <t id="10602">One of few craft in service with Heart of Albion that wasn't designed \(or stolen\) by Albionmetals. Instead it is manufactured by Theonray Defence Systems as that firm's only completely space-ready defence system product. Its armament is relatively weak but it is outfitted with a solid single-block Eterscel engine that has been praised as being an indestructible workhorse. This innovative engine is of a very unique design indeed; it can be lifted from one craft and mated with another \(even of a different type\) within less than two hours. Originally intended as a reconnaissance craft with limited tactical capabilities, the Eterscel Raider is nowadays mainly used a sector patrol craft.</t>
 <t id="10603">Eterscel</t>
 <t id="10701">{29101,10603} {29106,1101}</t>
 <t id="10702">Also manufactured by Theonray Defence Systems, the Eterscel Vanguard, unlike the Eterscel Raider, is not delivered as a space-ready system per se. It is BTO \(built to order\) and can be outfitted with a selection from two different hulls, one or two Eterscel single-block engines, and a range of weapons. As ordered by Heart of Albion, the Eterscel Vanguard is quite similar to the Eterscel Raider trading off lower acceleration parameters against the larger mass of its improved armament and different hull. Pilots across sectors are full of praise for the 'Eterscel' line of craft, particularly for its name-giving engines. It is very sought-after by privateers and achieves stellar prices on the used vehicle market.</t>
 <t id="10703">{29101,10603}</t>
 <t id="10801">{29101,10603} {29106,1201}</t>
 <t id="10802">Outfitted with two Eterscel solid-block low-maintenance engines, the Eterscel Sentinel is nearly as agile and fast as its little brother, the Eterscel Vanguard - but not quite, due to its more massive weapon array and larger hull. As with all ships of the 'Eterscel' line, the Eterscel Sentinel remains very popular outside military circles, even a decade after its original introduction.</t>
 <t id="10803">{29101,10603}</t>
 <t id="10901">Domelch</t>
 <t id="10902">This ship is frequently observed patrolling Reiver border sectors but it has also been used as a fast reconnaissance craft inside foreign sectors. Although not as agile as other craft of this class, the Domelch's high-acceleration engines make it hard to seek and destroy and thus, despite its below-average weapons systems, it is a natural choice for quick in-and-out missions to enemy territory.</t>
 <t id="11001">Cennelath</t>
 <t id="11002">The Cennelath is a fighter employed by the Reivers. It's not the fastest ship of the fleet, but it is reasonably agile and well armed, including an array of dumbfire missiles. In the early days of conflict against the Canterans, the Cennelath excelled in stalking their ships in asteroid fields.</t>
 <t id="11101">Maelchon</t>
 <t id="11102">Bearing the distinctive red painting seen on most Reiver combat vessels, the Maelchon is an advanced fighter with its main engine apparently based on an as-of-now undisclosed antimatter conversion technology. Since it is carrying an array of guided missiles, its acceleration parameters are not as good as one might expect. However, its low-latency attitude thrusters easily counter this flaw by offering great manoeuvrability. The Maelchon is almost exclusively used on patrol missions.</t>
 <t id="11201">{29101,11203} {29106,1001}</t>
 <t id="11202">The Triath Raider, while not a bad ship per se, does lack tactical capabilities due to its somewhat weak weapon system. As such, it's clearly the kind of design one would expect from PMC. Experts have no doubt about this; it is quite unlike the Golem and Moebius which couldn't have been designed by PMC alone. The Triath Raider is mainly used for patrolling undisputed territory but also used for scout and reconnaissance missions.</t>
 <t id="11203">Triath</t>
 <t id="11301">{29101,11203} {29106,1101}</t>
 <t id="11302">This craft, upon introduction to the forces, was a relief to all pilots who had had to risk their lives in PMC-designed vessels. Unlike other PMC designed ships, the Triath Vanguard features a reasonably balanced acceleration, good weapon systems \(including guided missiles\), a robust design and a somewhat modern layout. With an appearance not unlike an upgraded Triath Raider, this ship is said by combat pilots who have flown it in and out of battle to 'fly like a charm and bring you home too'. Rumour has it that PMC is working on heavier craft based on the Triath Vanguard's design, the first of which being the 'Triath Sentinel' for imminent release to active duty as at the time of writing.</t>
 <t id="11303">{29101,11203}</t>
 <t id="11401">{29101,11203} {29106,1201}</t>
 <t id="11402">Experts and pilots have nothing but respect for this latest fighter manufactured by PMC and its contractors. While certainly within the limits of what one could expect, the Triath Sentinel exceeds the design of any and all PMC ships so far with the exception, naturally, of the Golem and the Moebius. While not the fastest ship of its class, its manoeuvrability is better than average, as is its weapons array. Used mostly as reinforcements during imminent border incidents or similar conflicts, this brand-new vessel has yet to see serious combat. Experts, however, do not doubt that it will perform exceedingly well.</t>
 <t id="11403">{29101,11203}</t>
 <t id="11501">Katana</t>
 <t id="11502">The Katana is a fighter first deployed during the Terran Conflict. Once the cutting-edge of Terran engineering it is now technically average. About two decades ago the then newly launched Cantera Operation acquired a small fleet of used Katanas for security patrols after survey ships reported possible sightings of distant Argon ships in DeVries. The Republic of Cantera's Katana fleet is considered their greatest defensive asset and remains well maintained.</t>
 <t id="11601">Daito</t>
 <t id="11602">Based on the Katana, the Daito is the first new ship design from the Republic of Cantera Shipwrights for a decade. Often running trials and undergoing revisions and updates, this vessel is not as durable as its older cousin by a far stretch and it usually looks that way too. With average acceleration and manoeuvrability, its weak weapon systems makes it second choice at best when it comes to tactical situations.</t>
 <t id="11701">{29101,11703} {29106,3001}</t>
 <t id="11702">The Rahanas Bulk Freighter is designed upon a 'Common Ground' layout and built by several contractors. It is easily recognisable due to its distinctive storage modules that can load bulk goods only; its technical specifications, however, are not so remarkable.</t>

 <t id="12702">The Styrvok Freighter variants were designed by the Canterans and so have only been used in DeVries until now. Based on a relatively elderly and long-unaltered design, these ships often appear as beaten-up, well-patched work-horses that have seen much better days. They can still be built, for the right buyer, at a Canteran shipyard but the shiny newly-produced ones really stand out compared to the older much-used versions. Such new ones share the same specifications with the older models and so are not at all cutting-edge. Compared to other more modern freighter designs they are much smaller with less freight capacity, although that sometimes gives them an edge on pick-up and delivery speed. The roles of the single-ware and mixed-ware type models can be identified from the individually-distinctive cargo area designs.</t>

 <t id="13301">Stromvok</t>
 <t id="13302">The Stromvok is an interesting variant of the Styrvok Freighter line designed by the Canterans and used in DeVries. It is essentially a combat variant of the freighter line with its cargo area is almost entirely replaced by an armoured fighting compartment with a mixture of different sized turrets and ordnance storage. Whilst in no way considered as a warship capable of taking on a military destroyer or even a large group of fighters all at once, it can pack a powerful defence against small raider groups. It is suitable as a convoy escort or to guard an important transport ship. A cunning captain might even rely on its similarity to a Styrvok freighter to lure a moderate raider into a close attack of what appears to be a 'helpless' target - and then show it the sharp teeth of the trap it has unwittingly entered.</t>
 <t id="13401">Olmekron</t>
 <t id="13402">The Olmekron destroyer was designed and is built in Omicron Lyrae where its large and angular 'Y' shape is a common and reassuring sight. It is commonly employed by the Argon government and Jonferson Space Systems for escort and peacekeeping duties. Its relatively large size for a destroyer means some loss of speed and acceleration in comparison with other destroyers, but it is certainly on a par with them in terms of firepower as its weapon systems are quite technologically advanced in comparison. If it has a weakness, it is that its angular hull design offers less room for drone storage than many other destroyers.</t>
 <t id="13501">Fulmekron</t>
 <t id="13502">The Fulmekron destroyer is a rarer and even larger sister to the already large Olmekron destroyer built and commonly used in Omicron Lyrae. It keeps the angular 'Y' shape of its sister ship but is even bigger and more formidable-looking; it is the largest non-Xenon destroyer known to be in production. It is employed, albeit rarely, by the Argon government and by Jonferson Space Systems as a prestige escort, as an ultimate defence and for punitive attack duties. Its size hinders its acceleration, speed and manoeuvrability, but its greater bulk allows it to house even more technologically advanced weapon systems than the Olmekron. If it has a weakness outside of its speed and agility, it is that, like its sister the Olmekron, its angular hull design and many fixed weapons systems leave surprisingly little residual space for drone storage.</t>
 <t id="13601">Lyranea</t>
 <t id="13602">The Lyranea freighter is built in Omicron Lyrae where it is commonly seen in use by all the trading factions. Bigger than the equivalent Albion Rahanas in terms of size and cargo-space, it is somewhat slower. It is armed for self-defence purposes with more and larger weapons turrets than its Albion equivalent. Currently configured to be able to carry all classes of wares in multipurpose storage, the Lyranea design could most probably be easily converted for more efficient carriage of single or dual classes of wares - if the commercial demand were to be there.</t>
 <t id="13701">Lyramekron</t>
 <t id="13702">The Lyramekron is an interesting ship type designed and built in Omicron Lyrae. It is primarily an armed freighter but is largely constructed using the same parts and sections as the Olmekron destroyer type and so keeps that ship's distinctively large and angular 'Y' shape. The Lyramekron is employed by most major factions in Omicron Lyrae for delivery duties where hostilities are expected. Its relatively large size has allowed the fitting of technologically-advanced weaponry and defences almost on a par with those of a destroyer; it is even stated in its advertising that one fully-outfitted Lyramekron should shrug off an attack by a Xenon K with its typical fighter escort. Pirates looking for a victim, even if not deterred by something that looks very like an Olmekron destroyer, should find this freighter to be far more than they can cope with. However, its large size meanwhile hinders its speed and agility somewhat when compared to other large freighters. Paradoxically despite its overall size being much larger than the Lyranea freighter, its copious defence installations and the angular hull design restrict its potential freight storage to no more than that of the smaller Lyranea freighter.</t>
 <t id="13801">I</t>
 <t id="13802">Descended from the original Terraformers released by Earth about a millennium ago, the Xenon underwent many waves of machine evolution. Mechano-taxonometrists are fairly certain that the line of TF/Xenon present in the known sectors today belong to the ninth diversification branch \(of roughly 27\). The I/BRANCH9 - commonly referred to as just I - is probably the largest warship in the known galaxy. So far, it has only been spotted from great distances as nobody has lived through any closer encounter with it. It is therefore anticipated to be a most fearsome machine that, even if alone, has little to fear from other single capital ships or even modest fleets. Nothing more is really known about it yet rumour about it and paranoid false-sighting reports are rife. So far, and most fortunately, it has not been reliably reported to be seen venturing outside of Xenon core sectors. Indeed, it is not known if more than one of these behemoth war machines actually exists.</t>

As well as giving the Albatross the newly designed domed hull to better balance the ship when escaping attack, its cargo loading process was redesigned to pack wares more efficiently thereby increasing the room left for more cargo.

 <t id="15102">After more intense Xenon incursions into Teladi border systems such as Grand Exchange and Fields of Opportunity, the Teladi Company decided to redesign the Teladi fleet from the ground up with the focus on manoeuvrability and more effective shielding. The Phoenix was at the centre of this upheaval. After much experimentation, a domed design was chosen for the hull, which better protected the ship's vital systems as well as much improving turning and rolling speeds. After confirming that this design worked for the Phoenix, it was also applied to the rest of the fleet.</t>
 <t id="15103">Phoenix</t>
 <t id="15201">{29101, 15203}</t>
 <t id="15202">In order to provide the Teladi with a larger amount of fire power against the Xenon, it was decided during the redesign of the Condor that it should be turned into an all-out destroyer. A slightly smaller ship than the Phoenix, the new Condor shares the domed design of its sibling but focuses more on defence, with the hull providing wider shielding to its internal systems for better durability.</t>
 <t id="15203">Condor</t>
 <t id="15301">{29101, 15303} {29106, 3001}</t>
 <t id="15302">Ever the trusted ship for general trading, the Vulture was redesigned during the upheaval of the Teladi fleet to balance the shielding, not just around the vital systems but also around the cargo bay. Its domed design meant that it was a smaller target for enemy ships, and also greatly improved its manoeuvrability. Naturally, the improvements made to the cargo loading process and cargo bay of the Albatross were also made to the vulture, increasing an already impressive cargo capacity.</t>

 <t id="15702">The Toucan's passenger lounge was replaced with a medium-sized cargo bay after the creation of the Teladi Mass Transporter, which quickly became the popular method of local transport. This allowed the Company to focus even more on trade, and the Toucan is now used in support of the Vulture in station to station trading.</t>

 <t id="15802">Many of the design changes made during the upheaval of the Teladi fleet resulted in functional changes to its ships, but designers quickly found that fewer improvements were needed to the Falcon. Better rolling speeds were provided by the narrower, more open design, and it remains the same agile dogfighter as the previous iterations, but in comparison to other ships in the fleet, most of the changes made to the vessel were entirely aesthetic.</t>
 <t id="15803">Falcon</t>
 <t id="15901">{29101, 15903}</t>
 <t id="15902">These ships most commonly have only a single seat, though some do carry enough space for two or three people. They carry no weapons or shields, and can only transport between stations in a single zone. For this reason, their most common use is by civilians.</t>
 <t id="15903">Civilian Ship</t>
 <t id="16001">{29101, 16003}</t>
 <t id="16002">Mass Transporters are used by companies to ferry both their staff and their customers between stations in a single area. It is uncommon for them to carry any form of shields, and they are too small to support any armament. Depending on their exact size, they can carry between five and twenty people, including the pilot.</t>

 <t id="16202">While the upheaval in the Teladi military saw the discontinuation of the Buzzard, certain aspects of the fighter were integrated into the new design of the Harrier to make it a more complete military vessel. As well as being an able scout, the new Harrier can additionally function as a dogfighter and is capable of harassing larger and better-shielded heavy fighters.</t>

 <t id="16302">After the Teladi Company's shift in focus towards using small ships for collecting minerals from space, the Manorina was developed to perfectly fit this role. Its large storage bay and its capacity to equip powerful mining lasers means it is much more efficient than any older collection system. A variant of the Manorina was later developed to carry storage for gaseous and liquid wares, allowing the Company to completely replace their more expensive and less rewarding mineral and gas mines.</t>

 <t id="16801">Police APC</t>
 <t id="16802">Used for raids and other police field operations, the APC holds enough space for several police officers and breaching equipment. Its domed bow protects its vital systems from direct fire, as well as distributing weight across the vessel for more maneuverability at slower speeds.</t>
 <t id="16901">Police</t>
 <t id="16902">Used for general policing purposes, this police vehicle was built with three equally-distributed engines to ensure better manoeuvrability while flying the mass traffic lanes. Equipped with powerful scanning equipment, it is often used to scan ships for illegal goods before they come into stations.</t>
 <t id="17001">Police Transport</t>
 <t id="17002">This variant of the mass transporter is most commonly used to transport police personnel and security guards between stations, but also doubles as a prison transport. Built with maximum protection to the ship's vital systems and transporter bays in mind, this transporter is more durable than even the Police APC.</t>

 <t id="17202">One of the first ships to be created by Operation Cantera, the Onil could almost have been designed to withstand the natural dangers of working in a system such as DeVries. As such, and with configurations for the collection of both mineral and gaseous resources, it was the go-to vessel for mining in that area. However, it was only recently that the Republic of Cantera decided to release the ship's blueprints to the public market, in order to add a drastically-needed boost to their failing economy.</t>

 <t id="17402">The Zepp was designed and developed by Terracorp to carry useful information for Home of Light citizens quickly during the Dark caused by the Jump Gate shutdown. When the Gates re-awoke, individual stations also began using them for advertisements of their products, and these ships can now be found much further out in space in attempt to reach all citizens.</t>

 <t id="17501">{29101,17503}</t>
 <t id="17502">Intelligence states that this vessel is a reasonably new addition to the Xenon fleet, and is believed to the a mining vessel. Much like the various Argon mining ships, the Xenon S uses a laser to cut through larger asteroids before releasing smaller drones to collect the yielded resources. This has recently led to fearful questions from some corners of the scientific community as to why the Xenon are so deeply mimicing Argon behaviour.</t>
 <t id="17503">S</t>
 <t id="17601">{29101,17603}</t>
 <t id="17602">Going through a similar evolution to the Xenon capital ships, the P - indentified as a corvette-class combat ship - is still a vessel to be feared in combat. It is probably the most versatile Xenon ship in the fleet, used in both offence and defence, and capable of taking on both smaller, more agile and larger, bulkier vessels.</t>

 <t id="17802">Seemingly the Xenon response to the development of smaller Argon vessels capable of carrying and delivery large amounts of explosive firepower, the Xenon Q has been repurposed to fulfill a similar 'bomber' role. This makes it very effective at taking out larger and slower vessels, and it is suggested that this beast be tackled with a quick, agile fighter that is capable of avoiding missile attacks.</t>

 <t id="101">BoFu Star Complex</t>
 <t id="102">One of the largest food production factories in existence, each BoFu Star Complex comprises many BoFu Kitchens and produces basic nourishment for millions of living souls. In times of hardship and during military conflict, these installations become crucial to the survival of entire populations, and therefore, are regarded both a military target and an invaluable asset. During times of peace, BoFu Star Complexes are a sign of great prosperity. Run by AI and a large crew recruited from several species, the BoFu Star Complex is a good place to start a career by offering a number of different jobs in the food industry.</t>
 <t id="201">Mega Cellfab</t>
 <t id="202">The Mega Cellfab is a vast industrial complex dedicated to the manufacturing of ion and plasma cells. Its sheer size, its dependency on large numbers of sub contractors, and its importance for nearly all areas of economy and technology can make managing the Mega Cellfab a daunting task; without aid by AI and AGI it wouldn't be possible to sustain an efficient workflow.</t>
 <t id="301">Hardware Supplier</t>
 <t id="302">The Hardware Supplier manufactures materials needed for the construction of large scale structures such as ship hulls, station skeletons and accelerator rings. While not itself regarded as high-tech, most other high-tech manufacturers rely on materials produced here. The production of large structures requires capability to deliver vast quantities of extra-large building blocks. It is not unheard of for a Hardware Supplier to manufacture steel beams of multi-kilometre length, or coherent steel walls \(hulls\) of several square kilometres.</t>
 <t id="401">Crystal Refinery</t>
 <t id="402">The Crystal Refinery compound manufactures Cut Crystals for use in jewellery and for technical applications. The size of this operation is best described as 'breath-taking', and the vast quantities of crystals cut and processed make it hard to believe that there could possibly be enough buyers. However, the demand for cut crystals is high, and the market seems insatiable.</t>
 <t id="501">URV Integration</t>
 <t id="502">The URV Integration compound houses integration operations that produces different brand-named kinds of unmanned ranging vehicles for numerous applications; can build them in small to large quantities, executes system-integration and thoroughly tests each URV produced. Albeit organised and run by AGI and automated production processes exclusively, the URV Mass Line compound employs hundreds of skilled engineers and workers.</t>
 <t id="601">Capital Shipyard</t>
 <t id="602">The Capital Shipyard provides technical infrastructure for assembly, integration and testing of up to carrier-sized spacecraft. No critical system components such as thrusters, Jump Drives or generators are assembled on-site; they are delivered pre-built for systems integration.\n \nDue to its large size, the Capital Shipyard has life support and infrastructure to sustain a technical staff of up to 300 engineers.</t>
 <t id="701">Argnu Stockyard</t>
 <t id="702">Due to strict animal protection laws under Albion jurisdiction, the number of cattle permitted on a single Argnu Paradise biosphere is heavily restricted. To alleviate this restriction, up to four \(sometimes more\) Argnu Paradise platforms are joined to form a large breeding complex, known as an Argnu Stockyard.</t>
 <t id="801">Cell Fab Matrix</t>
 <t id="802">Central to all energy consuming operations, Ion Cells and Plasma Cells are mass-fabricated in huge numbers in the Cell Fab Matrix. The highly-sophisticated production lines are run autonomously and fully automated to increase throughput and reduce the risks of radioactive contamination to workers and engineers. Upon detection of system failures or for scheduled system maintenance, the Cell Manufacturer Complex must first be brought to a complete halt before any servicing be attempted.</t>
 <t id="901">Crystal Supplier</t>
 <t id="902">Specified to order, the Crystal Supplier compound processes raw crystalline structures into Cut Crystals either for use in jewellery or for a wide variety of applications. Crystal Suppliers are usually run fully-automated, and maintained by no more than one or two engineers.</t>
 <t id="1001">URV Parts Supply</t>
 <t id="1002">A URV Parts Supply complex \(the abbreviation 'URV' standing for 'unmanned ranging vehicles', or colloquially known as 'drones'\) is a highly-sophisticated technical manufacturing complex that incorporates many different lines of production, most of which are segregated from each other. Due to its complex nature, the URV Part Supply complex is run by a joint team of AGIs \(artificial general intelligences\) and engineers. Not unlike the Cell Fab Matrix, critical parts of this complex must be fully shut down before maintenance and servicing.</t>
 <t id="1101">URV BTO Line</t>
 <t id="1102">The URV BTO Line complex assembles components manufactured by the URV Parts Supply complex into fully functional URVs \(or drones\). Drones are BTO \(built to order\) singly or in variable-sized batches to meet a variety of user requirements, and each single drone has to undergo strict and specific-to-role testing. URV BTO Line complexes are run by a small staff of very-skilled URV designers and test engineers.</t>
 <t id="1201">Floating Meadows</t>
 <t id="1202">Floating Meadows are a complete biosphere optimised for the breeding of Argnu cattle and other livestock. The environment provided is complete with forage plants, green grass, insects and bacterial microbiology depending on the kind of livestock. Owing to animal protection laws, Floating Meadows are comparatively large installations with ample breeding spaces. Fully automated operation for a certain amount of time is possible, albeit not fully recommended.</t>
 <t id="1301">Foodstuffs Supply</t>
 <t id="1302">A large compound consisting of a variety of food production facilities that may range from Argnu Paradise platforms, Liquor Stills and even perhaps several Valley Forge Complexes. The Foodstuffs Supply Service Hub does not itself breed livestock or grow crops, it merely stores and processes raw food materials. Because of the variety of foodstuffs and changing nature of operations, the Foodstuffs Complex is run entirely manually by a variable number of staff.</t>
 <t id="1401">Staples Farmery</t>
 <t id="1402">The Staples Farmery is a processing facility specialising in mass production of basic foodstuff and nutrients. Since the materials being processed rarely change, the Staples Farmery can be run fully-automated, including delivery of raw supplies and shipping of processed and packaged goods.</t>
 <t id="1501">Ship Tech Fab</t>
 <t id="1502">The Ship Tech Fab specialises in manufacturing spaceship core components eg: fusion generators and Podkletnov devices. Several of the most important production facilities are located here to benefit from synergistic effects and, naturally, to improve economic viability.</t>
 <t id="1601">High Tech Fab</t>
 <t id="1602">Assembling a wide range of sophisticated electronics such as used aboard vessels and space installations, High Tech Fabs are examples of successful collaboration between advanced AGI \(artificial general intelligence\) and highly-skilled humans or aliens. Besides the production of high tech components, High Tech Fabs usually include research facilities and laboratories that constantly study new products and, more importantly, optimisation of existing manufacturing processes.</t>
 <t id="1701">Tech Laboratory</t>
 <t id="1702">Depending on the nature of the operation, a Technical Laboratory can either specialise in a narrow field or, more commonly, offer varied research according to customer specifications. Considered the secret engines of innovation, Technical Laboratories are usually the first to introduce new manufacturing processes or explore emerging lines of new technology. The licensing of newly-developed production methods, of advanced assembly techniques or use of new construction materials with different properties and handling, is therefore an integral part of the Technical Laboratory business model.</t>
 <t id="1801">Med Dispensary</t>
 <t id="1802">Similar to Tech Laboratories in basic operation, Medical Dispensaries research and manufacture all kinds of medicaments and pharmaceutical treatments for both humans and non-humans. They will often take up research and production to customer specifications as well. Med Dispensaries will usually have extensive research and development departments dedicated to finding new cures and treatments for persistent or multi-species ailments.</t>
 <t id="1901">Metalworks Yard</t>
 <t id="1902">The materials manufactured here are not only used in the construction of space installations or vessels but also for building structures on planetary surfaces. Regarded as a low-tech operation within a high-tech environment, the Metalworks Yard is an indispensable part of the general construction industry. It is usually operated without the aid of any advances AI or AGI.</t>
 <t id="2001">Arms Tech Fab</t>
 <t id="2002">Just as the Techno-Complex, the Arms Tech Fab \(or 'ATF'\) is run by sandboxed and AI-constrained AGI, and supervised by psychologically-monitored humans or aliens. Components manufactured range from miniaturised mechanical parts up to mobile platforms, and from simple nanotronic parts to energy-shielding assemblies. Working at the ATF is highly-paid, highly-respected, but psychologically very exhausting employment.</t>
 <t id="2101">Arms Tech Supply</t>
 <t id="2102">Much like a smaller version of the ATF \(Arms Tech Fab\), the Arms Tech Supply is sub-contracted to manufacture specialised weapon system components. Security considerations aboard the ATS platforms are as strict as those of the ATF.</t>
 <t id="2201">Integrative URV Forge</t>
 <t id="2202">Following the total lack of 3rd party high-tech products this facility was refurbished with some, although inefficient, effective machinery to still build the much needed drones that would otherwise be limited to those currently in use, and, with the Reivers causing them to thin out, there definitely is a demand rectifying the lower efficiency of this facility. It uses modified Construction URVs without the limitation to build independent structures, but in exchange their mobility had been severely limited to minimize the risk of their AGIs escaping their purpose.</t>
 <t id="2301">Civ Ship Parts Lot</t>
 <t id="2302">While not all parts required for the construction of civilian and mass-line spacecraft are manufactured on location, all of the core components actually are. The Civilian Ship Parts Lot is a conglomeration of technically-sophisticated operations that, as with most hi-tech ops, can only be run economically and efficiently with the aid of an AGI. However, a substantial engineering crew supervises the manufacturing process at all times.</t>
 <t id="2401">Civ Ship Dockyard</t>
 <t id="2402">The Civilian Ship Dockyard produces vessels targeted at the mass consumer market. Driven more by economical considerations than technical necessities, operations of this sort also include extensive non-technical departments eg: market-research and marketing. End-customers can order their ships finished in a rich variety of fashionable colours, ranging from such as ocean blue up to desert orange.</t>
 <t id="2501">Energy Array</t>
 <t id="2502">The Energy Array is basically an extensive formation of E-Cell Fabs that can be run almost autonomously over extended periods of time. The Energy Array does not manufacture Energy Cells; instead, it recharges vast amounts of depleted cells with an astonishingly high throughput. In theory, Energy Arrays provide sufficient technical infrastructure to include more than 8 E-Cell Fabs. In practice, however, a configuration of several separate smaller arrays of E-Cell Fabs is shown to work more efficiently.</t>
 <t id="2601">Spice Plantation</t>
 <t id="2602">The Spice Plantation does not exclusively grow spices for food-flavouring. In fact some do not produce food-flavourings at all. Instead, a wide variety of plants ranging from cut flowers to species-targeted medicinal plants all find specific conditions maintained aboard Spice Plantations that are ideal for growth and flowering or ripening as necessary. This is a low-tech operation almost comparable in this regard to Metal Supply Yards. Spice Plantations are run by a crew of skilled gardeners.</t>
 <t id="2701">H2O Additives Fac</t>
 <t id="2702">The H2O Additives Facility \(more commonly known as HAF\), uses distilled water from various sources and enriches it with minerals and trace elements as required by the appropriate target species. Most life-forms can consume enriched water meant for another species for a limited period but prolonged exposure to the wrong mixtures is not recommended.</t>
 <t id="2801">Valley Plantation</t>
 <t id="2802">The Valley Plantation is much like a rural conglomeration; six interconnected Valley Forge Complexes form a vast plantation area. Large fields of mostly wheat are protected by energy domes and either aligned for natural sunlight, or illuminated by a host of small artificial suns. Farmers and gardeners attend the fields without needing any complex AI; they usually live aboard the Valley Plantations with their families, forming small communities aptly known as 'valley villages'.</t>
 <t id="3001">Sky Meadows</t>
 <t id="3002">One of the largest stations in existence, the Sky Meadows is a gigantic orbital plantation, growing mostly wheat and, to a smaller extent, other crop. To sustain an artificial plantation of that size, biologists and engineers had to implement a complete ecosystem including microbiology, insects and even small mammals. The construction of the Sky Meadows took half a decade and the work of several thousand engineers. However, even then, establishing and balancing the ecosystem saw constant failures over more than a decade until it finally reached equilibrium at 12 years after completion of the structure. Today, a crew of 150 gardeners, workers and engineers run the complex and many of them live there permanently with their families. To them, the Sky Meadows is not only a working place and a job - it is their home.</t>
 <t id="3101">Xenon Station</t>
 <t id="3102">The exact purpose of this structure is as of yet still unknown. It does seem, however, to involve H2O collector stations, that have striking similarities to human-built models. Speculation is continuing as to why the Terraformer/Xenon require these quantities of H2O; some suggest that the machines may be conducting biological research of some sort.</t>

 <t id="3501">Way Station</t>
 <t id="3502">Assembled from the useful parts of ill-gotten stations and ships, mostly Terran in origin although the Reivers are not at all fussy, Reiver Way Stations demonstrate the absolute necessity of the Reivers to make do and recycle using what they can with surprising ingenuity just to continue to operate in their isolation. These certainly do not look at all purpose-built nor effective, indeed they often have weaknesses and vulnerabilities as a result of their patchwork nature, but they do indeed allow the Reivers to operate, rest and recuperate between raids and refit and rearm their ships. Despite their fragility, they usually house enough Reiver ships make them places to be very wary about, should one be discovered.</t>
 <t id="3601">Habitation</t>
 <t id="3602">In a bid to survive their isolation, the Canterans have adapted parts of decaying and damaged Terran mining and administrative stations into Habitations to house the remaining families. These Habitations provide living space and some security for the survivors but are an increasing burden to maintain and protect from the effects of entropy and the raids of Reivers. The Habitations are as bad as they look with damaged sections isolated and open to vacuum. Occasionally, elements are refitted using salvaged ship or station parts but, without further construction resources, the Habitations are doomed to eventually fail. The families eke out a living with spare supplies of stable basics but have little to no viable production capabilities left.</t>
 <t id="4401">Plutarch Exchange</t>
 <t id="4402">HQ of the Plutarch Mining Corporation in this sector, the Plutarch Exchange is a comparatively small station that has no on-site production whatsoever. Various types of minerals are traded here, many of them rare and largely unobtainable in other places. Known as 'the suit place' by miners across the sector, the Plutarch Exchange is run by businessmen; it is thus more reminiscent of a stock market than of a mining outlet.</t>
 <t id="4501">Escape Velocity</t>
 <t id="4502">The term 'Escape Velocity' usually means the speed at which an object leaves the gravitational well of a celestial body. This trading station, however, acquired its name because of the unique and cunning way that it uses to keeps clear off the planetary surface, even though it is way too close to hold its geostationary position naturally. Escape Velocity trades mainly in missiles, and is one of the very few \(if not the only\) privately owned operations to buy and re-sell missiles - at least legally.</t>
 <t id="4701">Techno-Complex</t>
 <t id="4702">As a compound manufacturing various high-tech components, mostly for use in military applications, the Techno-Complex relies heavily on AGI \(artificial general intelligence\). However, due to its critical nature in warhead production, it is ultimately supervised by humans or aliens. All AGIs are sandboxed and in-turn supervised by hard-wired AI. Also all biological life-forms are subjected to daily psychological examinations.</t>
 <t id="4801">Solar Energetics</t>
 <t id="4802">Solar Energetics is the name of this large conglomerate multi-band energy cell production facility. Always updating itself to the latest technologies, this Canteran-owned operation strives not only to squeeze the last few percent of efficiency out of already incredibly efficient solar cells, but simultaneously attempts to decrease the cost of the technology and so the cost and availability of energy. Solar Energetics is run by AI and a crew of about two hundred engineers and technicians.  Its headquarters staff are well-respected employers and allegedly lead the statistics for customer and employee satisfaction as they have already done for many consecutive years.</t>
 <t id="5001">URV Mass Line</t>
 <t id="5002">The URV Mass Line compound conduction production line assembly of a limited choice of URV types. Unlike the URV BTO Line compound, it does not have an own development and research department. Instead, it mass-produces URVs according to customer selection from a catalogue. Run by AI and not AGI, the URV MA does not require a full staff of engineers for its operation. Only a skeleton crew of skilled workers is required.</t>
 <t id="5101">Mega-Tank Farm</t>
 <t id="5102">The Mega-Tank Farm produces mainly plankton, soy beans and herbs \(for medical and non-medical applications\). Its array of vast tanks, from which it gets its name, its thriving hydroponics and green houses all earn the operation the colloquial name 'green lung'. Just as with other farming operations or plantations, gardeners and workers often bring their families to form stable communities in them. Ideally placed in a solar orbit, the Mega-Tank Farm can also be illuminated with artificial lights.</t>
 <t id="5201">Crystal Castle</t>
 <t id="5202">Left over from the Terran Conflict, this small structure used to be the Terran embassy on the area of the now-defunct Community of Planets. During the Terran Conflict it became the centre of intelligence and military operations and was re-named 'Crystal Castle'. Now, many decades later, with the Community of Planets long gone and Earth once again separated, the name still endures. Partially damaged during combat, Crystal Castle has now become a memory-laden human habitat and home to a small community that makes a living by producing food and meat.</t>
 <t id="5301">Wheat Plantation</t>
 <t id="5302">The Wheat Plantation is much like the Valley Plantation although considerably smaller. In many places a few Wheat Plantations are run in addition to the larger Valley Plantations. In such cases they usually provide added growing areas to existing valley village communities. In places where solely Wheat Plantations are run, there are no communities working and living aboard them, mainly due to the installation's comparatively small habitation areas.</t>
 <t id="5401">Water Distillery</t>
 <t id="5402">The Waster Distillery produces purified water that is not usually meant for consumption by biological life forms. Albeit seeming quite large, even when compared to other industrial compounds, the Distillery relies on a fairly straightforward technology and is mostly run without human intervention.  Water Distilleries are common sights across all sectors.</t>
 <t id="5501">BTO Ship Line</t>
 <t id="5502">Not as large as might be anticipated from its role, the BTO Ship Line compound assembles various types of vessels. Component parts are not manufactured on-site, but come from sub-constructors. The BTO Ship Line compound is basically a systems integration and testing site. The production of series-type ships here is quite limited; most vessels integrated here are pre-ordered and BTO \(built to order\). The unit is run for the most part by humans or aliens with only minimal aid by AI and no AGI.</t>
 <t id="5601">Solar Energy Farm</t>
 <t id="5602">The name 'Solar Energy Farm' is an oversimplification used colloquially to avoid the jaw breaking phrase 'Conglomerated Multiband Energy Cell Production Facility' which would be technically more correct. This installation uses advanced technology to capture solar power and convert it into usable energy at up to 99% efficiency. It is run mostly on fully-automatic; human intervention is only required in the case of damage that is not recoverable by the installation's mechanical self-repairing capabilities.</t>
 <t id="5701">R&amp;D Chem Lab</t>
 <t id="5702">The R&amp;D Chem Lab \(or, more correctly, the 'Research &amp; Development Chemical Laboratory'\) researches, designs and produces chemical compounds for a wide variety of applications. Encompassing molecular compounds for pure technical applications, chemicals for specialised medical treatments and various pseudo-fluids used in nano-tech, the R&amp;D Chemical Lab produces highly-specialised materials that are important in most areas of industrial manufacturing as well as in many areas touching day-to-day life.</t>
 <t id="5801">TechnoCore Hi-E</t>
 <t id="5802">Run by AGI because of the complexity and the danger in the technologies involved, the TechnoCore High-Energy facility manufactures, integrates and tests nearly all on-board systems of vessels and stations concerned with high energy operations. It mainly assembles components for middle-sized installations, while many of the products manufactured here will also find their way into small and private spacecraft.</t>
 <t id="5901">Cell Recharge Fac</t>
 <t id="5902">The Cell Recharge Facility provides limited docking facilities for the automated transfer of depleted fuel cells and charged cells from and into vessels. Usually, Cell Recharge Facs are outfitted with their own processing lines so allowing them to either re-purpose depleted cells or to produce new ones. Cell Recharge Facs can be run with just a core crew; however full automation is rarely desirable as vessels docking for fuel cell transfer often require manual adaptation of their docking protocols.</t>
 <t id="6001">Plutarch Overwatch</t>
 <t id="6002">Plutarch Overwatch is really a military complex that is frowned upon by the government, and not well-liked by the population. With its extensive weapons system and turrets, Plutarch Overwatch appears to be the company's bridgehead in DeVries. Legislation is underway that seeks to prevent privately-owned operations installing defensive or offensive weapon systems of such a capability that it may potentially threaten governmental organisations and the military. Until such laws become effective, however, Plutarch Overwatch must be regarded a legal operation even though it is de-facto, through force of arms, currently immune to common jurisdiction.</t>
 <t id="6101">TechnoCore Parts</t>
 <t id="6102">This facility is indispensable in the construction and manufacturing of crucial on-board systems of vessels and space installations. Components manufactured here can reach the sizes required for assembly of capital ships, orbital defence platforms and linear accelerator rings. Most of the large machinery aboard vessels and stations is engineered and integrated at the TechnoCore Parts facility.</t>
 <t id="6201">Pharma Lab</t>
 <t id="6202">The Pharmaceuticals Laboratory specialises in the production of chemicals for medical applications. Divided into separate departments, the Pharma Lab manufactures medicaments and aliments for several species, as well as multi-species narcotics for military applications. A research and development department is usually part of the Laboratory, as well as specialised facilities for the mass production of customised chemicals and agents.</t>
 <t id="6301">Metalframes Fab</t>
 <t id="6302">The Metalframes Fab processes refined steel and other alloys for the manufacture of large steel beams and numerous other heavy metal components. Even though most small and mid-sized space vessels today are no longer constructed mainly from steel, the demand for the steel is still high. In many places with higher-than-average radiation, steel-alloys can be more practical than energy shields or even PDD \(poly-diamandoid\). Many immobile space installations are constructed with a metal-alloy skeleton at their core.</t>
 <t id="6401">Plankton Tankfarm</t>
 <t id="6402">Considered one of the main sources of mass nutrition across all sectors and species, plankton is, and will be for some considerable time yet, in very high demand. The tendency to construct ever-larger Plankton Tankfarms continues. For now, however, this version is the largest purely plankton-based Tankfarm in existence. Due to the undemanding nature of plankton, it is easy to run unmanaged tanks of almost any size. No AGI, no AI, nor even gardeners are necessary to run and manage a Plankton Tankfarm; all it needs is alignment at a site in suitable sunlight until ready for harvesting.</t>
 <t id="6501">Large BTO Shipyard</t>
 <t id="6502">The Large BTO Shipyard is basically a skeleton structure meant for the construction, integration and testing of mid-size to extra large space vessels, stations or other installations. It does not offer the production of series-type models; each and every construction is custom built to order. Run by teams of AGI, AI, humans and aliens, Large BTO Shipyards have a workforce of hundreds, sometimes thousands of construction workers and engineers.</t>
 <t id="6601">Mass Shipyard</t>
 <t id="6602">The Mass Shipyard manufactures series-type models of small to middle-sized consumer spacecraft. Due to the fact that no custom-built vessels are produced, the manufacturing processes are highly streamlined and automated. Hence, only a small number of construction workers and engineers are required to run the Mass-Prod Shipyard.</t>
 <t id="6701">Retail Boatyard</t>
 <t id="6702">Similar to the Mass-Prod Shipyard, the Retail Boatyard assembles and integrates very small to small consumer vessels, as well as life-boats and sub-light rescue capsules. High levels of automation enable the production lines to be run with only a minimum number of personnel present. To maximise profitability, Retail Boatyards usually produce ships on behalf of more than one makers' brand-name.</t>
 <t id="6801">Solar Energy Array</t>
 <t id="6802">Solar Energy Arrays are huge fields of highly efficient solar panels. They function by converting more than 98% of all incoming sunlight into energy, then beaming it into a remote receiver station via focused microwave beam. SEAs do not have any material output at all; thus, no moving infrastructure is required, and the converters can be run totally unmanaged, at least theoretically, for prolonged periods of time. Solar Energy Arrays are most commonly placed in polar orbits around suns, but they can be found almost as often orbiting planets with direct beaming of power to planetary receptors.</t>
 <t id="6901">Soy Bean Farm</t>
 <t id="6902">Almost as essential for basic cross-species nutrition as the Plankton Tank Farm, the Soy Bean Farm is considerably larger than the PTF. Owing to the fact that soy beans are a rather more demanding to grow than plankton, that it needs more space for growing and hence more facility maintenance, it is not feasible to run a Soy bean Farm completely unattended. It is, however, still possible to run a vast Soy Bean Farm complex using a crew of less than 10 gardeners and engineers. Soy Bean Farms belong amongst the largest man-made space infrastructures in existence.</t>
 <t id="7001">Licensed Distillery</t>
 <t id="7002">In common vernacular, the Licensed Distillery is often called 'Fuel Fountain', although this term is regarded politically incorrect. Interestingly, alcohol-dependency is a condition unique to the human population. Nevertheless, alcohol-related deaths are still common among Split and, to a lesser extent, Teladi. For these reasons, the Licensed Distillery can only be run with tightly-controlled licensing that must be renewed with the authorities every four years. It is argued, however, that the strict liquor laws cause more problems than they prevent by encouraging corruption, smuggling and organised crime.</t>
 <t id="7101">Pharma-Spice Farm</t>
 <t id="7102">A supplier to Pharmaceutical Labs and other manufacturers, the Pharma-Spice Farm grows certain kinds of medicinal plants in vast quantities. No actual processing of plants takes place on-site except, of course, for harvesting, drying if necessary, packaging, and out-shipping of crops.</t>
 <t id="7201">Technology Megacomplex</t>
 <t id="7202">As a compound manufacturing various high-tech components, mostly for use in military applications, the Technology Megacomplex relies heavily on AGI (artificial general intelligence). Due to its critical nature in warhead production, however, it is ultimately supervised by humans or aliens. All AGIs are sandboxed and closely managed by hard-wired AI; all biological life-forms involved are subjected to daily psychological examinations.</t>
 <t id="7301">Water Prep Plant</t>
 <t id="7302">The Water Preparation Plant does not mine or harvest water itself; instead it relies upon third party water deliveries. The Water Prep Plant enriches water with minerals and trace elements  required by various target species. While most life-forms can consume water meant for another species for a limited period of time, prolonged exposure to the wrong type is most definitely not recommended.</t>
 <t id="7401">Mil Hi-Tech Dept</t>
 <t id="7402">A mid-sized space based infrastructure dedicated to the production of high-tech components. Products manufactured by the Military High-Tech Department range from miniaturised mechanical parts up to mobile platforms, and from simple nanotronic parts to energy shielding assemblies. Just as with other military high-tech compounds, the Mil Hi-Tech Dept is run by sandboxed and AI-constrained AGI, although supervised by psychologically-monitored humans or aliens.</t>
 <t id="7501">Mil Hi-Tech Manuf</t>
 <t id="7502">Most components required for the construction of high-tech weapons are manufactured off-site. The Military High Tech Manufactory is basically a sub-contractor for assembly, integration and testing of weapon systems. Security considerations aboard the MHTM are as strict as they are at the Mil Hi-Tech Dept; the facility is run by sandboxed AGI, hardwired AI and supervised by psychologically closely-monitored life forms. However, attempts at industrial espionage are frequent and, during armed conflicts, the Mil Hi-Tech Manuf is one of the main targets of enemy attacks.</t>
 <t id="7601">Construction Shop</t>
 <t id="7602">The Construction Shop \(also known as 'Construction Material Shop', or colloquially, among construction workers, 'The Shop'\) is a factory compound assembling a wide assortment of materials essential to construction of vessels and stationary installations. It features a considerable number of different manufacturing lines, hence it requires a complex and well-orchestrated supply chain. While most individual production lines can run fully automated, the operation of the compound as a whole is run by a crew of up to a hundred or more engineers and construction workers.</t>
 <t id="7701">Foundry</t>
 <t id="7702">Foundries were once used to mine raw minerals straight from the asteroid they were connected to, but after the Teladi made the mineral harvesting process more efficient through the use of mining ships, they realised their mines no longer had purpose. In order to increase their efficiency further, mines were turned into Foundries so that mineral collection and refinement into Teladianium was completed in one place. This meant they could shut down their slower, less efficient Teladianium Foundries and send the product of the Foundries straight to their shipyards for use.</t>
 <t id="7801">Water Collector</t>
 <t id="7802">Water Collectors break down the ice brought to them by miners; heating it until it becomes a liquid, and purifying it. The water produced from these stations is both drinkable and usable in food production, making a Water Collector one of the galaxy's most valuable assets.</t>
 <t id="7901">Xenon Matrix</t>
 <t id="7902">No information available.</t>
 <t id="8001">Haunt</t>
 <t id="8002">Haunts are very rarely built; instead, it is more common to see previously abandoned stations repurposed by pirates for use as a headquarters or base. In this role, haunts are often the centre of most major pirate operations, and so must be large enough to support both a large number of people and a reasonable black market. Some factions have been known to pull parts of different abandoned stations together to support these needs, if a suitable station cannot be found intact.</t>
 <t id="8201">Den</t>
 <t id="8202">Dens are often placed at chokepoints that pirates will use to lure people into traps. They also serve well as small bases, from which scouts can be launched to keep an eye on activity in the local area.</t>
 <t id="8301">Colony Station</t>
 <t id="8302">Stations built by the Toride Colonists on their arrival in the eponymous system, these colony stations are now home to the Atlas pirates, who commandeered them as their own when the Colonists were forced to leave Toride.</t>
 <t id="8401">Unidentifiable Station</t>
 <t id="8402">{20102,7902}</t>
 <t id="8501">Terracorp HQ</t>
 <t id="8502">Once just the headquaters of a single company, since the Jump Gate shutdown, the Terracorp HQ has become the effective capitol for Home of Light, Toride and Cold Star. It is from here that CEO Dal Nirin governs both the corporate matters of Terracorp's business and the economic matters of the Argon and Terran people of those three systems. It also serves as the headquarters to the Terracorp Security Fleet, which is employed to keep the area safe from all outside threats.</t>
 <t id="8601">Warehouse</t>
 <t id="8602">These stations are nothing more than a collection of bound together storage modules. They are used primarly to hold wares bought with no immediate selling option, but can also function as trading stations in themselves should the owner so choose, in that wares stored here can be sold as stock in competition to dedicated producers.</t>
 <t id="8701">Highway Station</t>
 <t id="8702">Designed as a solution to the growing population of Home of Light during the Jump Gate shutdown, these habitat-stations were placed close to highways to ensure fast travel and less traffic around the system.</t>
 <t id="8801">Travel Lodge</t>
 <t id="8802">Offering bed and board to those travelling through the tri-system \(collective for Cold Star, Home of Light and Toride\), travel lodges are located along the highway ring orbiting Home of Light as a go-between, where it is easy to find security and comfort against the dangers of space travel.</t>
 <t id="8901">Colony Outpost</t>
 <t id="8902">These small outpost stations were set up by the Toride Colonists after they discovered the threats on the outskirts of their new home to watch over the areas of the system deemed more difficult to defend. Like the larger colony stations, some of these outposts were commandeered by the Atlas Pirates after the Colonists fled the system.</t>
 <t id="9001">Hydrogen-3 Facility</t>
 <t id="9002">These facilities are specifically designed to extract hydrogen-3 from inside asteroids, and as such are usually build into these asteroids' surfaces. To stop the hydrogen from immediately escaping when extracted, large containment fields are built around the facility, and excess gas is caught by pipes pulling it back towards the stations storage modules.</t>
 <t id="9101">Mineral Mine</t>
 <t id="9102">Based off the design of the ore and silicon mines used before the move towards mining asteroid fields using ships, the mineral mine is capable of extracting both ore and silicion from asteroids that are deemed to yield a high supply of both. Extraction is carried out by an army of automated pneumatic drills controlled from the mine's central hub, and will usually continue until the asteroid is completely hollowed out.</t>
 <t id="9201">Aqueduct Water Collector</t>
 <t id="9202">A relic of the time before the Jump Gate shutdown, the Aqueduct-class water collection station was the last resource-collection station built by Bolo Mu Aquatic Solutions \(BMAS\) before the company began developing cheaper and more efficient methods of gathering resources using mining ships. This spelled the end for resource-collection stations, and only a few Aqueduct-class stations were built throughout the universe before it was decommissioned.</t>
 <t id="9301">Business Centre</t>
 <t id="9302">At the beating heart of the tri-system is the beating heart of Home of Light; the men and women who work day in, day out to ensure life is always comfortable across the system. Business centres hold office upon office filled with such people, placed along the central highway ring to ensure they can reach their workplace, and at the end of each day their homes, as quickly as possible.</t>
 <t id="9401">Place of Worship</t>
 <t id="9402">Religion has not always been looked upon kindly in this age of continuously improving technology and science, but, particularly after their reunion with the Terran Toride Colonists, Terracorp have strived to make Home of Light a place where all feel comfortable, and so have constructed multi-religious places of worship along their central highway ring for those inclined to visit whenever they feel it necessary.</t>
 <t id="9501">Terracorp Offices</t>
 <t id="9502">Those who work directly fr the corporation solely responsible for every person's wellbeing in Home of Light, Cold Star and Toride work in segregated offices along Home of Light's central highway ring. These are functionally the same as other business centres, but additionally give the workers access to Terracorp's huge database and computer network, ensuring smooth and efficient progress throughout all three systems.</t>

<page id="29103" title="Legacy Landmarks" descr="Text for Legacy Landmarks from XR - This should be removed with Legacy Folder" voice="no">
 <t id="101">Badlands Colony</t>
 <t id="102">Originally installed by the Plutarch Mining Corporation, the so called Badlands Colony, not actually a colony but a mining operation, was however repurposed after the Albion gate powered down and as since served as an actual colony and stronghold to PMC senior staff. The fragment of the Broken Moon the station was built into had supposedly been chosen due to a large tunnel leading all the way from one side of the rock to the other allowing easy access to its interior through many shafts driven into its walls. One part of the installation still serves as a mining facility and is commonly referred to as The Mines.</t>
 <t id="201">Lonely Giant</t>
 <t id="202">Probably a candidate for the title of Profiteroid 2.0 the Lonely Giant brims with a strange concentration of 99% pure Hydrogen-3 in crystalline form. The visible crystals on the surface only amount for a tiny fraction of what deep scans have revealed to be immense chasms on the inside filled up with frozen Hydrogen-3. However, both the reason why the Lonely giant did not yet melt under the heat of Albion's central star nor willingly spread its wealth is the immensely hard silicate a majority of the rock is made up from, giving the PMC a hard time twisting its innards. For the meantime the two massive rocks orbiting one another are held in a containment field trapping the subliming Hydrogen-3 gas emanating from the surface crystals with the pretty side-effect of illuminating the whole scene in a soothing picturesque turquoise as the gas touches the particle barrier.</t>
 <t id="301">Core Dig</t>
 <t id="302">The Core Dig was the most prominent source for the Iridium isotope Ir-209, also known as the famous 'Unobtainium'. This is a stable and highly heat-resistant anti-ferromagnetic complex agent perfectly suited for fusion reaction containment. Such containment suffered from the previous lack of a material that was not also radio-activated under constant neutron radiation. Iridium-209, formerly considered non-existent in nature and ineffective through cost to synthesise, seemed to fit the bill. Unfortunately, as Matter/Antimatter technology emerged and increased its hold on the reactor market, Unobtainium faced a severe decline in demand and resale value compared to the cost of extraction and processing. The Core Dig now operates with a reduced crew and has redirected its operations to extract and store the trace Nividium also present in the minerals available.</t>
 <t id="401">Lost Colony</t>
 <t id="402">The crude technology this large installation is based on still bears a glimpse of genius. Its core consists of a series of tunnel connections between some junction structures of different sizes upon which the surrounding gases were made to condense and crystallize under the influence of a chemical catalyst. Today the station has a crystalline coating of varying thickness between 100 and 500 Metres and will most likely form a solid asteroid-like mega-crystal a couple hundred years from now. The Lost Colony already has pioneers dig into the thicker areas of the coating expanding the station into it with some success now which makes it clear that this colony may very well grow into something far more befitting of such name.</t>
 <t id="601">The Aqueduct</t>
 <t id="602">As the M/AM drives gained popularity this behemoth among freshwater supply stations was quickly abandoned in favour of more readily accessible water sources. Before that however the Aqueduct was the Maelstrom system's largest freshwater supply installation and probably one of the largest facilities of its kind in the known universe. Today it is being swarmed by Xenon who lurk within the dense clouds of frozen H2O that span the space between the many asteroids around the Sable Vortex.</t>
 <t id="701">The Maze</t>
 <t id="702">Named for the countless natural and artificial tunnels that snake through it, the Maze is the huge broken asteroid in which the Jump Gate in Fields of Opportunity is situated. The nature of the tunnels, which run from one end of the asteroid to the other, lead the Teladi to believe that the Maze was broken up for mining by one of the system's previous occupants, though there is no evidence to suggest who these settlers may have been.</t>
 <t id="801">Overwatch</t>
 <t id="802">Though Overwatch still receives a supply of Teladianium from the foundries in Fields of Opportunity, after a Jump Gate realignment the Habitat-class "superstation" was cut off from most of the technology it requires to manufacture ships from its dedicated shipyard. Even though it now depends on Albion for these technologies, Overwatch still has much to offer the system, since it provides food and energy to all the stations still scattered across Serpentine Haze and Fatal Path. More importantly, however, it is home to thousands of Teladi civilians and the headquarters of the Teladi Union, making it the first port of call for any traveller coming to Fields of Opportunity.</t>
 <t id="901">War Memorial</t>
 <t id="902">The Teladi of Fields of Opportunity have always struggled against the Xenon that exist on the outskirts of the system, but mass incursions into the system by the Xenon are rare. When they have occurred, however, they have always ended in bloodshed. The so-called "War Memorial" is perhaps the largest of the battle scars, and was left in the far north of Serpentine Haze in commemoration of the Teladi who sacrificed themselves to make sure their comrades would escape unharmed.\n\nRealising that they did not have the firepower to push the Xenon back, three Teladi captains ordered their crews to abandon ship before ramming the Branch 9 Xenon K leading the attack and causing it to crash into the side of an asteroid. The subsequent explosion destroyed everything in the vicinity, but ended what had been one of the Teladi's most vicious and bloody conflicts.</t>

 <t id="101">HIT/MA Turret</t>
 <t id="102">The High Throughput Mass Accelerator, or HIT/MA for short, is without doubt the most common mass driver weapon across all sectors. It is not an attack weapon per se and as such is often found on non-military vessels as a means of self-defence and deterrence.\n \nThe projectiles used by the HIT/MA and similar low-mass accelerator weapons are called 'pellets'. Due to their relatively low mass and firing velocity, the impact damage caused by a single pellet is average at best. What makes the HIT/MA worthwhile, however, is precisely the low mass and size of its pellets: they can be stored in large numbers aboard even average-sized vessels.\n \nThe HIT/MA fires pellets at a high rate of fire and herein lies its main strength. It can easily take down torpedoes and other small targets, however it is utterly ineffective against larger or shielded vessels.</t>
 <t id="201">Hailstorm/MA Turret</t>
 <t id="202">The Hailstorm Mass Accelerator is a high-profile weapon system reserved only for the most advanced military installations and vessels. The projectiles \(called 'pellets'\) employed by the system, albeit of low range, are emitted at high muzzle velocities and thus carry a considerable amount of kinetic energy.\n \nWhat makes the Hailstorm/MA a truly formidable weapon, however, is its ability to emit large clusters of pellets \(commonly referred to as 'Pellet Hailstorms'\) at once. It can easily take down missiles, drones and even small fighter craft. Its targeting accuracy is, in a way, high; even though not all fired pellets hit their target, the bulk rarely miss.</t>
 <t id="301">Plasma/MA Turret</t>
 <t id="302">Even though this weapon emits super-heated plasma, from a technical and physical standpoint it is still considered a mass accelerator. Contrary to other MA weapons, the Plasma/MA system does not fire pellets; instead it employs small dots of ionised matter drawn one at a time from a magnetic storage device.\n \nDespite its many shortcomings \(low muzzle velocity, low firing rate and low accuracy\) the Plasma/MA causes relatively high levels of damage; its kinetic energy is fully effective on impact and the super-heated plasma spreads destruction over a larger area immediately after impact.\n \nIneffective against agile vessels such as fighters with their ability to dodge the slow moving plasma dots, the Plasma/MA is the weapon of choice against larger vessels such as capital ships.</t>
 <t id="401">Plasma/JET LR Turret</t>
 <t id="402">The Plasma/JET LR system \(LR standing for 'long ranging'\) is technically related to the Plasma/MA weapon. Strictly speaking, it is still considered a mass accelerator although it is usually grouped under tactical energy weapons rather than MA systems.\n \nThe Plasma/JET LR fires a super-heated beam of ionized matter that can stretch across several kilometres of space. Its accuracy is high, as is the damage on impact. However, it must be taken into consideration that the damage inflicted decreases proportionate to target distance.\n \nThis weapon system is very effective against large targets such as capital ships but is difficult to lock on to small and agile moving targets.</t>
 <t id="501">HIVI/MA Turret</t>
 <t id="502">The High Vigour Mass Accelerator \(or short 'HIVI/MA'\) derives its large destructive force through the sheer mass of its projectiles. In contrast to smaller MA systems, the projectiles are called 'orbs' rather than 'pellets'. The large diameter of the orbs makes the system impractical to mount on small or medium vessels; but they are quite common as stationary defences.\n \nFiring rate and exit velocity are very low, as is the targeting accuracy. Precision strikes against smaller targets are therefore out of the question, so leaving strikes against large installations and capital ships as the main area of application for the HIVI/MA system.\n \nThe HIVI/MA's destructive force can only be called excessive; it can destroy entire surface areas in a single strike.</t>
 <t id="601">V Launcher</t>
 <t id="602">The V Launcher is a medium-sized turret that launches missiles of the type Newtonian V Crusher. Its accuracy is low, while range and damage on impact are average. The V Launcher is especially effective against surface elements on capital ships, but can also be used to lay barrage against fighters. Its effectiveness when used against small targets, however, is at best questionable; small and agile vessels can usually evade this type of slow moving, unguided missile.</t>
 <t id="701">Astrobee Launcher</t>
 <t id="702">The Astrobee Launcher is more than just a simple turret; it is a highly advanced and technically complex weapon system capable of deploying swarms or 'shoals' of Astrobee Swarmkiller missiles. Its deployment rate of successive swarms/shoals is arguably low, but this is rendered nearly irrelevant due to the AGI-guided nature of the Astrobee Swarmkiller missile. The high targeting accuracy and range that can be achieved using the Astrobee Launcher should also be noted. This weapon system is most effective when used to take out drones and fighter craft.</t>
 <t id="801">Force Field Projector Mk1</t>
 <t id="802">The Force Field Projector \(colloquially also known as 'Shield Generator'\) generates an ultra-strong gravito-magnetic field capable of deflecting many forms of matter, matter streams, and energy. Its field intensity \(i.e. density\) decreases to the third power over distance; therefore, the force it is emitting \(and likewise, capable of withstanding\) is a product of energy output and distance to its magnetic focal point. Mounting Force Field Projectors in close proximity to the objects/features they are protecting reduces energy requirements and is common practice - but it is also a systemic weak point that can't be mitigated easily.\n \nThe FFP Mk1 is a very widespread system, found on most commercial vessels and stations. Its main purpose is the deflection of micro asteroids, ionised particles and cosmic background radiation. Its use as a defence against attack weapons is limited.</t>
 <t id="901">Force Field Projector Mk2</t>
 <t id="902">The Force Field Projector \(colloquially also known as 'Shield Generator'\) generates an ultra-strong gravito-magnetic field capable of deflecting many forms of matter, matter streams, and energy.

Mounting Force Field Projectors in close proximity to the objects/features they are protecting reduces energy requirements and is common practice - but it is also a systemic weak point that can't be mitigated easily.\n \nThe FFP Mk2 is the standard model used by all military stations and vessels that are not expected to see heavy combat on a daily basis. Its defence against micro asteroids and cosmic radiation is superb, even at relativistic speeds. Defence against attack weapons \(kinetic as well as energetic\) is good/acceptable outside of large-scale tactical situations.</t>
 <t id="1001">Force Field Projector Mk3</t>
 <t id="1002">The Force Field Projector \(colloquially also known as 'Shield Generator'\) generates an ultra-strong gravito-magnetic field capable of deflecting many forms of matter, matter streams, and energy. Its field intensity \(i.e. density\) decreases to the third power over distance; therefore, the force it is emitting \(and likewise, capable of withstanding\) is a product of energy output and distance to its magnetic focal point. Mounting Force Field Projectors in close proximity to the objects/features they are protecting reduces energy requirements and is common practice - but it is also a systemic weak point that can't be mitigated easily.\n \nThe FFP Mk3 is the most advanced Force Field Projector available. Its energy requirements are excessive, but it field-strength can withstand heavy combat situations over a prolonged period of time, and is even sufficient to avert nuclear weapons and small antimatter explosive devices.</t>
 <t id="1101">Directed Fusion Propulsion</t>
 <t id="1102">The Directed Fusion Propulsion is a conventional reaction engine that uses either Deuterium or Lithium \(depending on availability\) in a directed fusion process to generate thrust. Nearly all interplanetary and medium-sized vessels are outfitted with a DFP engine; the exceptions being the smallest boats and some stationary satellites that still rely on chemical propulsion methods.</t>
 <t id="1201">Matter/Antimatter Drive</t>
 <t id="1202">For a long time, the use of M/AM drives was limited to very small vessels like message drones \(belonging to a class of self-propelled objects called 'pen craft'\). The reason for this was the low availability of antimatter. Only after vessels from long-lost planet Earth proved that larger size M/AM drives were sustainable, research in mass production of antimatter began. The first one to market an H to -H processing plant was inventor Ser-Alman Jonferson.\n \nToday, many medium and large-sized vessels are equipped with M/AM-drives, shortening journeys between planets substantially compared to e.g. directed fusion propulsion systems.\n \nThe M/AM drive is considered a conventional reaction propulsion engine.</t>
 <t id="1301">JSDD Ramjet</t>
 <t id="1302">The JSDD Ramjet \(also known as 'JSDD drive'\) is basically an M/AM drive with drastically improved efficiency, connected to an H to -H \(hydrogen to anti-hydrogen\) converter that is fed by a magnetic collector. This type of engine can collect its own fuel by harvesting H molecules from space; however, while a great concept on paper, the shortcomings of the systems lie in the scarcity of H molecules in deep space. Therefore, the JSDD Ramjet works best in planetary nebulae, and not at all in the void between stars. Ships using this system usually also have an alternative means of propulsion.</t>
 <t id="1401">Jump Tunnel Device</t>
 <t id="1402">The name 'Jump Tunnel Device' is a huge technical understatement. This highly advanced device is capable of projecting a temporary micro-singularity with determinable entry and exit points. Its range of operation is not as vast as that of a Jump Gate \(which is theoretically unlimited\), but with careful calibration, in-sector jumps ranging from light seconds to light hours can be achieved. Because of its energy consumption, only capital ships can operate Jump Tunnel Devices.\n \nThe Jump Tunnel Device is based on the groundbreaking work of Dr. Siobhan Inja Norman.</t>
 <t id="1501">Drone Launch Pad</t>
 <t id="1502">The Drone Launch Pad \(sometimes also referred to as 'URV Launch and Recovery Facility', or simply 'URV Launcher'\) is required to launch and recover various types of drones and URVs \(Unmanned Ranging Vehicles\). It is also capable of refuelling -H based drones, and Lithium-Fusion based URVs.\n \nMost capital ships are equipped with Drone Launch Pads.</t>
 <t id="1601">Scanning Array</t>
 <t id="1602">Scanning Arrays employ different means of detecting mass and energy signatures of objects. Although the name may suggest otherwise, Scanning Arrays are purely passive devices. Their sensitivity \(i.e. range\) is proportional to the size of their detectors and number of antennae and is affected by the rating of their amplifying circuits and processing software. In many cases, large ships are capable of carrying larger Scanning Arrays, resulting in longer range and better resolution.</t>
 <t id="1701">Mining Turret</t>
 <t id="1702">The Mining Turret produces a penetrative plasma vortex within target asteroids or rocks, splitting them into smaller pieces that may eventually be collected by drones for mining purposes. This turret is unsuitable for engaging targets other than rocks and asteroids.</t>
 <t id="1801">Force Field Projector</t>
 <t id="1802">The Force Field Projector \(colloquially also known as 'Shield Generator'\) generates an ultra-strong gravito-magnetic field capable of deflecting many forms of matter, matter streams, and energy. Its field intensity \(i.e. density\) decreases to the third power over distance; therefore, the force it is emitting \(and likewise, capable of withstanding\) is a product of energy output and distance to its magnetic focal point. Mounting Force Field Projectors in close proximity to the objects/features they are protecting reduces energy requirements and is common practice - but it is also a systemic weak point that can't be mitigated easily.</t>
 <t id="1901">Ragefire Turret</t>
 <t id="1902">This turret spits out heaps of large-sized plasma projectiles which, although not very precisely aimed, are likely to split open whatever they rain down on. The used plasma being both charged and burning hot makes it an effective weapon to both tear down enemy shields as well as the enemy itself. There is a downside to this weapon system so popular among the Split though: its effective range is very limited.</t>
 <t id="2001">Capital Field Generator Mk1</t>
 <t id="2002">The Capital Field Generator \(colloquially also known as 'Capital Shield Generator'\) generates a conformal ultra-strong gravito-magnetic field capable of deflecting many forms of matter, matter streams, and energy. It uses complex wave shaping and multiple source channelling to give a uniform field intensity \(i.e. density\) just over the hull surface of any capital ship that can mount it. As a result, the precise positioning of the generator on the hull surface is no longer critical to total hull coverage as in the case of Force Field Projectors.\n \nThe CFG Mk1 is a common system, usually found on capital ships unlikely to see much combat. Its main purpose is the deflection of micro asteroids, ionised particles and cosmic background radiation. Its use as a defence against attack weapons is necessarily somewhat limited but they do add protection cumulatively; the more generators that are mounted, the stronger the hull shielding.\n \nThe generator surface elements are protected by their own fields which must be overcome before the generator can be disabled by direct attack. The sheer size of these generators and their complex source distribution mounted over the hull surface restrict their use to the larger capital ships.</t>
 <t id="2101">Capital Field Generator Mk2</t>

Its main purpose remains the deflection of micro asteroids, ionised particles and cosmic background radiation, for which it is superbly suited even at relativistic speeds. Use of a single CFG Mk2 as a defence against attack weapons \(kinetic as well as energetic\) is good/acceptable outside of large-scale tactical situations. However they do add protection cumulatively; the more generators types that are mounted, the stronger the hull shielding.\n \nThe generator surface elements are protected by their own fields which must be overcome before the generator can be disabled by direct attack. The sheer size of these larger generators and their complex source distribution mounted over the hull surface restrict their use to the larger capital ships.</t>
 <t id="2201">Capital Field Generator Mk3</t>

As a result, the precise positioning of the generator on the hull surface is no longer critical to total hull coverage as in the case of Force Field Projectors.\n \nThe huge CFG Mk3 is the most advanced and expensive Capital Field Generator available and is found on only the most powerful large capital warships. Its energy requirements are quite excessive, but its field-strength negates the most severe space particle and radiation hazards and it can withstand even heavy combat situations over a prolonged period of time; even one CGG Mk3 is sufficient to temporarily avert most nuclear impacts and small antimatter explosive devices. They add protection cumulatively; the more generators types that are mounted, the stronger the hull shielding - if you can fit them.\n \nThe generator surface elements are protected by their own fields which must be overcome before the generator can be disabled by direct attack. The sheer size of these huge generators and their complex source distribution mounted over the hull surface restrict their use to the larger capital ships.</t>
 <t id="2301">(generic)Turret</t>
 <t id="2302">(generic)Often placed along potentially weaker points of stations and larger ships, turrets hold the advantage of a much greater range of influence than fixed mounted weapons. In recent times, many different types of turret have been developed, and they have become increasingly popular across most of known space, requiring those who wish to combat ships and station using them to develop more complex and more defined strategies to avoid being shot down.</t>

 <t id="101">Pulsed Maser Mk1</t>
 <t id="102">The Pulsed Maser represents the pinnacle of high-energy no-projectile weaponry. It delivers high firing rates, unmatched accuracy, short travel-times and a good impact damage when scoring consecutive hits, making it the standard issue weapon for many fighter craft of the known space-faring species.</t>
 <t id="201">Pulsed Maser Mk2</t>
 <t id="202">The Pulsed Maser Mk2 improves its predecessor's output energies considerably granting higher impact damage as well as increased effective range while preserving the rapid fire-rates and accuracy the Pulsed Maser is known for.</t>
 <t id="301">Plasma Repeater Mk1</t>
 <t id="302">The Plasma Repeater fires small charged plasma projectiles by venting a previously pressurized containment chamber. This process yields excellent energy efficiency and high impact damage but due to the nature of plasma dynamics the firing vector can vary thus reducing the total accuracy of these weapons. The plasma projectiles travel comparatively slow and are rendered harmless after their charge dissolves and returns the plasma to a gaseous state, still, it remains the weapon of choice against slow and easy targets.</t>
 <t id="401">Plasma Repeater Mk2</t>
 <t id="402">The Plasma Repeater Mk2 improves over its predecessor design by adding increased output volume while compressing the plasma even further making for both increased damage and range. This model still suffers from the comparatively slow projectile speeds, limiting its peak effectiveness to slow and easy targets.</t>
 <t id="501">Missile Launcher</t>
 <t id="502">This common feature of fighter craft allows for various types of missiles to be loaded and fired safely. Its integrated thrust pipes keep the firing ship steady instead of pushing it away from the launched missile like one would otherwise expect.</t>
 <t id="601">Mining Laser</t>
 <t id="602">The Mining Laser is a high-frequency laser device which carries enough energy to ionise matter along its path, forming a brilliant vortex of ionized plasma. The penetration and expansion of this plasma vortex within mineral substances is usually sufficient to crack the target asteroid or rock into many smaller portions. Eventually these can be small enough for collection by mining drones. While very effective at breaking up rocks for subsequent mining, the standard Mk1 Mining Laser is unsuitable for ship-to-ship combat.</t>
 <t id="701">IHC Cannon</t>
 <t id="702">The Integrated High Calibre Cannon, or 'Insanely Huge Cannon' as it is sometimes called by the laymen, fires a supersized dense matter projectile at high muzzle velocities resulting in it being one of the most destructive weapon systems to be found far and wide. The plans of all IHC weaponry are based on the same principles even though most of them are custom made for a specific ship type and are therefore to be considered integral to it.</t>
 <t id="801">Limpet Mine Launcher</t>
 <t id="802">An alternative to the missle launcher, this launcher fires limpet mines, which attach themselves to an object's surface to be remotely detonated later.</t>
 <t id="901">Pulsed Maser Mk3</t>
 <t id="902">Similar in range and fire-rate to the Mk2, the Pulsed Maser Mk3 uses different projectiles to its predecessor. Instead of a single high-damage energy impact, the Mk3 projectile, fired from alternating barrels, dissipates its energy over a longer period causing small amounts of damage over a period of time.</t>
 <t id="1101">Heavy Laser Mk1</t>
 <t id="1102">The Heavy Laser Mk1 is a powerful beam weapon that delivers enough energy to damage ship shields. However, it is still an improved version of the Mk2 Mining Laser and as such also makes for an effective mining tool.</t>
 <t id="1201">Bomb Launcher</t>
 <t id="1202">Capable of dropping deadly explosives that detonate on impact at short range, the bomb launcher is most commonly attached to Assault Drones for use against very slow or stationary targets.</t>

 <t id="3501">Missile Forge</t>
 <t id="3502">The Missile Forge manufactures guided and unguided missiles with warheads ranging from conventional to nuclear and M/AM devices. Its relatively harmless appearance belies its real purpose and hazardous nature.</t>
 <t id="3601">URV Wharf</t>
 <t id="3602">The URV Wharf \(better known as 'Drone Wharf'\) manufactures various models of Unmanned Ranging Vehicles \(drones\). It includes testing facilities for quality assurance inspection of random production samples.</t>
 <t id="3701">Shield Facility</t>
 <t id="3702">Nowadays, the manufacture of shield generators is more of an integration and assembly process than a complete production from the ground up. The Shield Facility employs well-established system integration and testing procedures to assemble shield generators of all sizes and performance levels from detail parts supplied by third-party manufacturers.</t>
 <t id="3801">LV Shipyard</t>
 <t id="3802">Like most shipyards for large vessels and stations, the LV Shipyard \('LV' standing for 'Large Vessel'\) basically consists of a framework or skeleton offering easy access to the vessel under construction and for keeping unassembled parts in nearby secure storage within the construction site.</t>
 <t id="3901">Medium Shipyard</t>
 <t id="3902">Unlike the LV Shipyard, the Medium Shipyard assembles medium-class ships for military and civilian applications. Instead of single-ship assembly utilising an access-skeleton, the Medium Shipyard can execute up to eight construction and integration tasks at once.</t>
 <t id="4001">XLV Ship Cradle</t>
 <t id="4002">An XLV Ship Cradle \('XLV' standing for 'Extra Large Vessel'\) consists of a vast access-skeleton \(or framework\) that is often erected just for the job at hand, ie: the construction of a single ship. In other instances, however, the access-skeleton remains between construction tasks and is merely re-fitted to suit any change of XLV ship specifications.</t>
 <t id="4101">Turret Forge</t>
 <t id="4102">In the Turret Forge, standard issue and BTO \(built to order\) weapon turrets of all specifications and dimensions are assembled. Apart from assembly, the Turret Forge can also store a limited amount of standard turrets prior to distribution. Some larger Turret Forges are actually required by law to hold aside a certain part of their production for governmental and military use.</t>
 <t id="4201">Command Relay</t>
 <t id="4202">The Command Relay \(or 'CR'\) greatly extends the range over which a secure command channel can be established with remote vessels. Its transceiver radio dish operates on a multiplexed broadband spectrum.</t>
 <t id="4301">Bulk Tube Stack</t>
 <t id="4302">Consisting of not much more than two small parallel tubes, the Bulk Tube Stack is particularly suited for the storage of stackable goods. If necessary it can provide a basic atmosphere and heating but, lacking a fully-capable life support system, it is totally unsuitable for livestock.</t>
 <t id="4401">Tesla Duo-Charger</t>
 <t id="4402">As with the basic Tesla Charger, the method by which the Tesla Duo-Charger stores energy is as simple as it is efficient: rated conversion capacitors \(either antimatter or quantum singularity based\) can accept and convert extremely high voltages and currents and preserve their potential energy nearly indefinitely before discharge is required. The Duo-Charger features two parallel capacitor chains.</t>
 <t id="4501">Liquid Spheroid</t>
 <t id="4502">The Liquid Spheroid is fully automated storage facility with the sole purpose of storing various liquids prior to distribution. Several detachable spherical tanks are bundled into one central access unit, depending upon the type of liquid they are to contain.</t>
 <t id="4601">Container Storage</t>
 <t id="4602">A typical Container Storage module \(or 'CSm'\) offers multiple slots for container attachments. The CSm does not provide any type of connection for atmosphere, heating or life support. Goods that demand certain environmental conditions in transit must therefore be stored in containers providing these conditions internally and self-sufficiently.</t>
 <t id="4701">Tesla Charger</t>
 <t id="4702">The method by which the Tesla Charger stores energy is the same as that of the Tesla Duo Charger: rated conversion capacitors, either antimatter or quantum singularity-based store energy nearly indefinitely. In contrast to the Tesla Duo Charger, the Tesla Charger features only a single capacitor chain.</t>
 <t id="4801">Filling Station</t>
 <t id="4802">Used by all but the very largest of vessels, Filling Stations provide spaceships of most types and sizes with energy and fuel cells. Some Filling Stations are run automatically but most include administrative areas since attachment and detachment of the large supply containers needs close supervision, not just for technical reasons but also to detect and deter hijackers.</t>
 <t id="4901">Duo-Sphere</t>
 <t id="4902">The Duo-Sphere features two large spherical tanks that most commonly hold drinking water for one or two species. They can also be used for various other liquids but, prior to any change of content, the spherical liquid tanks must be replaced.</t>
 <t id="5001">Farm Module S</t>
 <t id="5002">The Farm Module S, like its larger sibling, is host to an agricultural node, complete with processing units and hydroponics except everything non-essential was rationalised away making for a smaller material footprint.</t>
 <t id="5101">Wheat Storage S</t>
 <t id="5102">The economy class version of its larger and more common sibling. Apart from the obvious difference in storage volume the Wheat Storage S still operates just like one would expect a wheat storage to operate. It stores wheat.</t>
 <t id="5201">Water Reservoir S</t>
 <t id="5202">This custom fitted water tank does hold less water than its more common siblings but makes up for it by compressing its content instead of just storing it. </t>
 <t id="5301">Xenon Module</t>
 <t id="5302">Next to nothing is known about these kind of modules. Experts suggest that there may be different kinds of these modules, all looking exactly the same and thus explaining the irregular readings collected so far.</t>
 <t id="5401">Xenon Apparatus</t>
 <t id="5402">Collected readings show that unorganized matter goes in at one end and structured machinery comes out the other, beyond that the inner workings of these kind of modules remains essentially a blank page.</t>
 <t id="5501">Xenon Repository</t>
 <t id="5502">Recent analysis has shown there to be some sort of exchange of objects going in and out of these structures, it is unclear to what end this happens but the most likely explanation would be that it serves some kind of storing purpose.</t>
 <t id="5601">Terran Module</t>
 <t id="5602">Nothing can be said with certainty about these Terran structures, they may be just connection bridges, on the other hand, they may actually serve a different purpose entirely.</t>
 <t id="5701">Terran Processing</t>
 <t id="5702">Careful observation and leaked information alike point towards these kind of modules hosting a set of processing machinery, speculations go as far as to classify them as production modules but no pressing evidence supporting that theory has yet been disclosed.</t>
 <t id="5801">Terran Depot</t>
 <t id="5802">Scans of these kind of modules have shown signatures of many different objects, each in great numbers. Going by these leads one could conclude that they are storage modules but only the Terran would know for sure.</t>
 <t id="5901">Defensive Phalanx</t>
 <t id="5902">Equipped with various weapon systems, there is no doubt about this module serving but one purpose: taking down all hostiles. Unless the hostiles bring a whole fleet, this module will always succeed.</t>
 <t id="6001">Life Staples</t>
 <t id="6002">The Life Staples modules house the environmental controls and life-necessities distribution centres for Canteran stations. Given the scarcity of staples and resources, these modules are constantly manned and monitored for food and water rationing purposes. The desks in these modules also control the movement of goods into and out of Storage Bays. They also act as distribution and supply for medical aid and medicines. Given their essential purpose, there may be more than one in a large station structure.</t>
 <t id="6101">Storage Bay</t>
 <t id="6102">Storage Bays are station modules that contain the life-support necessities for the station, typically containers of energy cells, foodstuffs, liquids, and whatever wares and resources can be scavenged and held here for future needs. Often stored without environmental control, these modules have to be entered with protection and caution when items are needed to be stored or retrieved. Due to their ad hoc but essential nature, these modules are seldom large and several may be found within one station structure.</t>
 <t id="6201">Administration</t>
 <t id="6202">The Administration modules house the nerve-centres of the stations. Typically central command and control, environmental control and bureaucratic elements are found in these modules. For safety and redundancy given the dilapidated structures and hostility of the area, there may be more than one such module in a station structure.</t>
 <t id="6301">Recycling</t>
 <t id="6302">The 'Recycling' module is where the Reivers unpack their ill-gotten gains and either distribute some directly to participants in the raids, or use them to support whatever production capacity they may have to keep their ships and Way Stations operational. Given the nature of the Reiver 'procurement' methods, the stores that pass in and out between Recycling and Storage Bays are largely unknown and unpredictable. There may be more than one such module in a Way Station to cater for different natures of goods, but this reasoning is purely guesswork.</t>
 <t id="6401">Badlands Minehead</t>
 <t id="6402">The Badlands Minehead, locally known as 'The Mines', is a vast mining structure that visibly fills the centre of the broken piece of moon that the Badlands Colony occupies. Thought to tunnel deeply, if not through, the moon segment, extraction of Ore and Silicon is made from the many side tunnels and galleries.</t>
 <t id="6501">Badlands Silo</t>
 <t id="6502">Scattered around outside the area of the Badlands Minehead on the broken segment of moon are various silos where the Silicon and Ore produced by the Minehead are stored. Individually known as a Badlands Silo, they collectively ensure that production and storage is not stopped by any isolated local instability in the crust or access tunnels due to ongoing mining activities.</t>
 <t id="6601">Core Minehead</t>
 <t id="6602">The Core Minehead is the central structure embedded in the core of this landmark. Originally intended to extract Iridium-209, or 'Unobtainium', the Minehead was re-purposed when the demand for that product fell with the arrival of Matter/Antimatter technology. Now the Minehead just extracts Nividium, aka platinum, to resource the Nividium Cube production and other industrial catalyst requirements. The Minehead now has much spare mining capacity since the change in extraction levels and so needs relatively little on-site storage.</t>
 <t id="6701">Core Stockpile</t>
 <t id="6702">The Core Stockpile is the sole remaining operational storage facility at Core Dig. The rest having been decommissioned since the change in extraction target from Iridium to Nividium. The Stockpile is kept secure as the stocks of Nividium in there are quite small and safe and easy to handle, yet remain relatively valuable. The Stockpile thus makes an attractive target for raiders and opportunists.</t>
 <t id="6801">Hydrogen Barrier</t>
 <t id="6802">A total of five Hydrogen Barriers surround the central Lonely Giant asteroid. Each particle Barrier contains and extracts the Hydrogen-3 or 'H3' that sublimes from the H3 crystals exposed on the surface and also trapped deep within the two huge and close-orbiting silicate rocks that make up the asteroid. Each Barrier contributes to the overall capture and storage of this rare and expensive resource.</t>
 <t id="6901">H3 Tank Farm</t>
 <t id="6902">The storage facility that compresses and stores the H3 captured by the Hydrogen Barriers is called an H3 Tank Farm because of the sheer number of small high pressure tanks connected into a matrix. The Tank Farm has many shutoffs and one-way valves so that if any connection or tank suffers damage for any reason, the remaining tanks would be isolated and keep their valuable contents.</t>
 <t id="7001">Habitat Ring Extension</t>
 <t id="7002">This module extends the Habitat-class superstation so that it can support additional modules behind its primary ring. These attach to the extension module in a spoke-like fashion.</t>
 <t id="7101">Habitat Ring Column</t>
 <t id="7102">Used primarily for structural support between a Habitat-class superstation's centre and its primary ring, this spoke-like column also holds quarters for the station's workers and inhabitants.</t>
 <t id="7201">Habitat Centre Complex</t>
 <t id="7202">Forming the heart of the Habitat-class superstation, the HCC houses most of its administrative sectors, as well as about a third of its living space.</t>
 <t id="7301">Habitat City</t>
 <t id="7302">Placed in the inner-side of the Habitat-class superstation's primary ring, the city is home to thousands of citizens and station workers. When designing the station, the Teladi Company attempted to make the city suitable not just for Teladi, but for as many species as possible, and so it is not unusual to find cities with many different biomes.</t>
 <t id="7401">Habitat Centre Ring</t>
 <t id="7402">Forming the central structural support to the Habitat-class superstation's primary ring, this small ring also extends from the Habitat Centre Complex to act as an entrance to the station for any ships that wish to dock.</t>
 <t id="7501">Habitat Trade Centre</t>
 <t id="7502">These components of the Habitat-class superstation house huge trading floors where official and civilian traders can go to trade wares and produce.</t>
 <t id="7601">Habitat Bridge</t>
 <t id="7602">As well as acting as secondary support for the Habitat-class superstation's primary ring, the bridge also provides high-speed transport from the ring to the complex centre and ring extension, allowing citizens and station workers to travel around the station.</t>
 <t id="7701">Teladianium Production Module</t>
 <t id="7702">This module is split into two sections. As Teladian mud is fed into the first section, it is mixed with the chemicals or minerals required to make Teladianium. It is then fed into the second section, where it is allowed to dry slowly over time and take its solid form.</t>
 <t id="7801">Asteroid Research Module</t>
 <t id="7802">The minerals that are drawn from the asteroids to which these modules attach are not usually enough for the production of teladianium, but do have several scientific uses. The research carried out at these stations revolves primarily around improvements to the strength, durability and weight of Teladianium.</t>
 <t id="7901">Hydro Turbines</t>
 <t id="7902">The efficiency of a water collector can be improved by sending any wasted water through a hydro turbine, which then powers the heaters used by the collector to melt the ice. This ensures that a collector is always able to produce, even if only in very small amounts.</t>
 <t id="8001">Scrap Yard</t>
 <t id="8002">A playground for pirates, mechanics and technicians alike, the scrap yard is an open collection of wares and resources that, while useless alone, often help in the improvement or modification of ship and weapon components. Commonly found at pirate outposts, scrap yards operate on a first-come, first-served, no-returns basis.</t>
 <t id="8101">Weapon Platform</t>
 <t id="8102">Designed to function as a standing defence for stations against all assailants, the diversity of the weapon platform makes attacking a station incredibly difficult, and so it has become a must for all serious station builders.</t>
 <t id="8201">Station Harbour</t>
 <t id="8202">The station harbour was developed to extend far enough away from a station so that capital ships could dock easily and without danger of damaging the station itself. Able to dial into the station's mass-traffic network, the harbour has the added effect of making it easier for drones from the docked capital ship to find a direct line to the station, greatly increasing the speed at which trades can be carried out.</t>

<page id="29108" title="Legacy Playership Upgrades" descr="Text for Legacy Playership upgrades from XR - this should be removed with Legacy folder" voice="no">
 <t id="101">Equalized Engine Mk1</t>
 <t id="102">The Equalized Engine Mk1 balances its output around all aspects of importance. Its forward acceleration is to be considered medium as well as its drift and strafe capabilities and is its turning momentum.</t>
 <t id="201">Equalized Engine Mk3</t>
 <t id="202">The Equalized Engine Mk3 improves over its previous iteration with increased overall output while preserving the same balance among all critical systems. Forward thrust is decent as are drift and strafe peak velocities and acceleration, turning speed does not fall behind either.</t>
 <t id="301">Equalized Engine Mk4</t>
 <t id="302">This vastly improved model delivers better performance on all ends. The engine delivers good forward thrust, the same can be said for drifting, turning and strafing.</t>
 <t id="401">Equalized Engine Mk5</t>
 <t id="402">The mother of all engines, tuned to be the ultimate all-rounder. The Equalized Engine Mk5 delivers formidable forward thrust, strafe speeds, turnaround speed and drift acceleration.</t>
 <t id="501">Sidewinder Engine Mk2</t>
 <t id="502">The Sidewinder Engine Mk2 trades some forward thrust potential for increased turning momentum and improved strafing speed and acceleration. One may also consider the slight decrease in peak drift speeds compared to a more balanced solution.</t>
 <t id="601">Sidewinder Engine Mk3</t>
 <t id="602">The third generation of Sidewinder Engines, while slightly improving on drift and forward speeds, stay true to their philosophy of putting manoeuvrability before top speeds and are therefore outfitted with further improvements to turning momentum, strafing speed and acceleration thereof.</t>
 <t id="701">Sidewinder Engine Mk4</t>
 <t id="702">This generously tuned engine opens up a whole new world of manoeuvrability. As overall output was increased a slight performance gain in terms of forward and drift acceleration is noticeable but the real treat are impeccable strafing speed as well as acceleration in conjunction with blazing turnaround momentum.</t>
 <t id="801">Sidewinder Engine Mk5</t>
 <t id="802">The pinnacle of engineering the Mk5, optimized for crazy manoeuvrability, stands supremely over the rest. At least when it comes to turning speed, strafe accelerating and strafe peak velocities. Forward thrust and acceleration are actually decent yet unimpressive.</t>
 <t id="901">Supercharged Engine Mk2</t>
 <t id="902">The Supercharged Engine Mk2 was specifically modified to provide increased forward speed and acceleration at the expense of secondary thrusters resulting in reduced strafe speed and velocity as well as lower turnaround momentum.</t>
 <t id="1001">Supercharged Engine Mk3</t>
 <t id="1002">The third generation model delivers even higher peak velocities while strafing and turning capabilities were only improved marginally.</t>
 <t id="1101">Supercharged Engine Mk4</t>
 <t id="1102">The greatly optimized Mk4 delivers breathtaking top speeds and quick acceleration yet still suffers from reduced turning rates and strafing capabilities.</t>
 <t id="1201">Supercharged Engine Mk5</t>
 <t id="1202">The undisputed king of the hill in terms of speed and acceleration, any more and you might black out just from taking a slight turn at half speed. The trade-off however imposes limitations on manoeuvrability specs such as turning speed and strafe acceleration as well as speed thereof.</t>
 <t id="1301">Steady Shield Mk1</t>
 <t id="1302">The Steady Shield Mk1 provides medium capacity at medium recharge rates, its balanced design makes it a good choice for most situations.</t>
 <t id="1401">Steady Shield Mk3</t>
 <t id="1402">The Steady Shield Mk3 offers improved capacity as well as recharge rates. It remains a well-balanced piece of technology and a good companion in the majority of situations.</t>
 <t id="1501">Steady Shield Mk4</t>
 <t id="1502">The greatly improved fourth generation Steady Shield sets new rules on the battlefield offering decent matrix capacity alongside equally powerful recharge inductor coils.</t>
 <t id="1601">Steady Shield Mk5</t>
 <t id="1602">Supremacy is at hand with this nicely balanced monstrosity. The Mk5 provides great protection with its large support injectors resulting in over the top effective capacity and bigger, better and more inductor coils let the shields quickly recover.</t>
 <t id="1701">Behemoth Shield Mk2</t>
 <t id="1702">The Behemoth Shield Mk2 lets you take considerably more hits before its matrix breaks down by constantly feeding energy through the induction coils, this however results in a slower recharge-rate as the remaining bandwidth is decreased.</t>
 <t id="1801">Behemoth Shield Mk3</t>
 <t id="1802">The improved model of the Behemoth Shield employs additional power conduits to directly stream additional energy into the shield matrix, therefore building up a constant surplus resulting in even higher effective capacity. While this approach reduces the strain on inductor coils it does not really improve them either resulting in only slightly higher recharge rates.</t>
 <t id="1901">Behemoth Shield Mk4</t>
 <t id="1902">Components specifically designed to support the shield matrix by expanding its inherent capacity greatly improve the Behemoth Shield's Mk4 version, an additional inductor coil slightly increases the recharge rates to match the large capacity.</t>
 <t id="2001">Behemoth Shield Mk5</t>
 <t id="2002">With the Behemoth Shield Mk5 one may rightfully believe to be the immovable object resisting the unstoppable force. The sheer size of the two interlinked and supercharged shield-matrices connected to the most powerful generator known across the galaxy renders any ship into a flying fortress. Recharging such a large pool takes quite some time.</t>
 <t id="2101">Dashing Shield Mk2</t>
 <t id="2102">The Dashing Shield Mk2 withholds a small amount of energy from the matrix and releases it upon taking hits, feeding back energy into the matrix this way circumvents the inductor coil's bandwidth limitation and results in a faster recharge rate at the expense of effective shield capacity.</t>
 <t id="2201">Dashing Shield Mk3</t>
 <t id="2202">Going beyond just being a modification, the third generation Dashing Shield employs additional inductor coils alongside a slightly more powerful shield matrix resulting in even faster recharge rates at a moderate shield capacity too.</t>
 <t id="2301">Dashing Shield Mk4</t>
 <t id="2302">A major redesign for the shield architecture now has three smaller matrices coupled together and connected to an auxiliary core constantly feeding a large capacitor, which quickly discharges into the weakest matrix. The process is moderated with specifically designed inductor coils that can easily transfer surplus energy to another matrix. The result is a lightning-fast recharge rate and a decent shield capacity although the capacity cannot yet stand up to a standard-issue Mk3 model.</t>
 <t id="2401">Dashing Shield Mk5</t>
 <t id="2402">The absolute best of the best in terms of recharge rates and still delivering a considerable capacity. The Dashing Shield Mk5 now uses additional auxiliary capacitors as well as additional inductor coils with large spark-gaps to allow unprecedented bandwidth alongside a smart coolant system allowing to constantly supercharge them. The result is a shield that, unless depleted in the blink of an eye, goes back to full power in another blink. While the shield capacity has also increased due to the constant supercharging it is far from impregnable though.</t>
 <t id="2501">Pulsed Maser Mk1</t>
 <t id="2502">A modified or prototype version of the popular Pulsed Maser Mk1 used by many a spacecraft out there. A rapidly pulsing maser source carries residual matter near the muzzle, propelling it at high speeds and impressive accuracy towards a target. The small mass of the projectile limit the damage potential but the high firing rate and very short travel time make it a real good weapon still.</t>
 <t id="2601">Pulsed Maser Mk2</t>
 <t id="2602">Combining the perks of the Albion Pride's original Pulsed Maser and the commercially circulating models of the Mk2 series this upgraded custom-fitted version delivers increased range and heightened energy output.</t>
 <t id="2701">Plasma Cannon Mk1</t>
 <t id="2702">The Plasma Cannon, unlike the commercially circulated Repeater, does not just fire many smaller projectiles but instead shoots a massive orb of superheated charged plasma at the target while maintaining decent accuracy. The projectile is slow however, therefore being most effective against close by or slow targets which, when hit, suffer great damage. The weapon needs to prepare the projectile before it can be shot which greatly impacts the firing rate and heat dissipation.</t>
 <t id="2801">Plasma Cannon Mk2</t>
 <t id="2802">A prolonged plasma chamber and a modified Plasma Repeater compressor enhance both payload and range of the Plasma Cannon Mk2. A refitted turret heat sink keeps the weapon from overheating instantly and allow for the same moderate firing rate as the original Mk1 version.</t>
 <t id="2901">Inertial Hammer Mk1</t>
 <t id="2902">Accelerating charged particles in a synchrotron and then shooting them through a layer of ferromagnetic fluid causes said fluid to be violently accelerated in a small cone away from muzzle causing considerable disturbances in hit shield matrices as well as easily ripping apart thick armour plating. However, there is a downside to the weapon: its accuracy is arguably low as its payload is spread out in a cone and its range is limited as well. Still, the Inertial Hammer gets the job done - really well.</t>
 <t id="3001">Inertial Hammer Mk2</t>
 <t id="3002">This upgraded replica of the original Inertial Hammer has custom-fitted heat sinks built in to allow for a more powerful synchrotron radiation source. The linear accelerator has also been modified to couple the combined kinetic energy of the passing particles and then instead accelerating fewer, more massive particles, namely protons, to achieve a higher efficiency and therefore slightly larger projectiles, that multiplied by the higher number of particles makes for an even deadlier squash.</t>
 <t id="3101">Particle Repeater Mk1</t>
 <t id="3102">This weapon uses a constant beam of electrons extracted from a plasma chamber to then shoot it back at the resulting positively charged plasma which clings to the electron stream forming an inverted atomic super-structure for a couple of seconds - seconds that more than suffice to reach any target within visible range and discharge. The Particle Repeater provides ultra-high firing rates with a very good damage throughput at the expense of sustainability as it quickly reaches temperatures that no heat sink could ever compensate for.</t>
 <t id="3201">Particle Repeater Mk2</t>
 <t id="3202">A major overhaul of the firing mechanism using a heavier negative charged plasma and a positron beam enables higher temperatures through M/AM annihilation taking place in the projectile after it leaves the weapon. Even fitted with cutting-edge heat sinks the weapon still produces excessive infra-red radiation and fire remains unsustainable beyond a couple of seconds.</t>
 <t id="3301">Mining Laser Mk1</t>
 <t id="3302">The Mining Laser is a high-frequency laser device which carries enough energy to ionise matter along its path, forming a brilliant vortex of ionized plasma. The penetration and expansion of this plasma vortex within mineral substances is usually sufficient to crack the target asteroid or rock into many smaller portions. Eventually these can be small enough for collection by mining drones. While very effective at breaking up rocks for subsequent mining, the standard Mk1 Mining Laser is unsuitable for ship-to-ship combat.</t>
 <t id="3401">Mining Laser Mk2</t>
 <t id="3402">A controlled infusion of Hydrogen gas and a higher frequency for the driving laser increase the effective range and throughput of the Mining Laser Mk2. The result: faster and more effective rock-breaking, with the added benefit of limited viability as a weapon of last-resort - one should not expect to be able to 'mine' enemy ships or stations, however.</t>
 <t id="3501">Basic Scanner</t>
 <t id="3502">A multichannel electromagnetic probing device or more commonly known as 'Scanner'. It allows the analysis of objects beyond just their shape, many basic features can be deduced from data collected through passively looking at or actively shooting EM radiation of all kinds of frequencies and amplitudes at a target.</t>
 <t id="3601">Advanced Scanner</t>
 <t id="3602">The advanced model has been rid of all artificially imposed limitations, although exposure over a longer period of time might increase the risk of getting microwave-cooked and sudden incineration it also helps to make sense of data that would otherwise make none by simply cranking up the volume and look behind any shielding or scrambling there is.</t>
 <t id="3701">Police Scanner</t>
 <t id="3702">Employing specific characteristic wavelengths these active probing devices reveal any of the many possible target signatures, it's only a matter of time - usually a couple of seconds.</t>
 <t id="3801">Trading Computer Mk1</t>
 <t id="3802">Normally, a pilot has to fly around a station and contact the various traders to build up a complete picture of the current trade offers available at the station. With this Trading Computer upgrade installed, a pilot merely needs to fly close enough to a station and the various trade offers from the station's facilities will be made available for viewing via the ship's computer. Fly to another station and new trading information is added. This information is kept updated for up to several hours, but can become invalid after a while should any ware cease to be traded at a station, for whatever reason. Information can be filtered and sorted. Pilots should note that the Trading Computer alone does not unlock all station information, nor attract the potential discounts that may become available through thorough exploration of entire stations. These discounts can still be found in the usual way, even with the Trading Computer installed. See your local Mechanic for access to this excellent and time-saving trading upgrade.</t>
 <t id="3901">Argon Shipwrights 'Pride Mk1' Adventurer Configuration</t>
 <t id="3902">The Pride Mk1 Adventurer Configuration is the original cockpit design for the Albion Pride. The ship itself never went into mass production because of cost, but the cockpit configuration became the basis for a standard design used in many other ships.</t>
 <t id="4001">Jonferco 'Trapezium Mk2' Merchant Configuration</t>
 <t id="4002">The Trapezium Mk2 Merchant Configuration was originally intended as a pilot training platform. However, its easy-to-operate design quickly became popular among traders, leading Jonferson Space Systems to mass-produce it for the general market. The production version includes improved interior decor intended to appeal particularly to traders wanting to project an image of wealth.</t>
 <t id="4101">Jonferco 'Hawk Mk3' Combat Configuration</t>
 <t id="4102">The Hawk Mk3 Combat Configuration was designed for maximum visibility and minimum vulnerability. The command room uses large screens which project images obtained from cameras mounted outside the ship. This allows traditional cockpit cage struts to be replaced with minimal screen borders, giving the pilot the best possible view. Some pilots refer to this as the "Blue Moon" configuration because of the blue standby screen shown on the monitors when they first boot up.</t>
 <t id="4201">Jonferco 'Crane Mk2' Management Configuration</t>
 <t id="4202">The Crane Mk2 Management Configuration has a utilitarian design, favoured by master builders with only construction on their minds. The heavy cage around the pilot provides security and shock-absorbing capabilities, while the ultra-strong glass provides improved protection against collisions with the debris that can often be found around construction sites.</t>
 <t id="4301">Trading Computer Mk2</t>
 <t id="4302">This software upgrade allows management of an increased number of planned trips for trade orders. The features of the Mk1 version are also included.</t>
 <t id="4401">Trading Computer Mk3</t>
 <t id="4402">This software upgrade allows management of even more planned trips for trade orders than the Mk2 version. The features of the Mk1 version are also included.</t>
 <t id="4501">Targeting System Extension Mk1</t>
 <t id="4502">The Mk1 Targeting System Extension improves on the basic targeting system by allowing a ship computer to additionally target nearby dropped cargo and cycle through them at an ease.</t>
 <t id="4601">Targeting System Extension Mk2</t>
 <t id="4602">The Mk2 Targeting System Extension improves on its predecessor by adding recognition of the surface elements of a target or nearby object to the targeting system.</t>
 <t id="4701">Particle Repeater Mk3</t>
 <t id="4702">{20108, 3202}</t>
 <t id="4801">Plasma Cannon Mk3</t>
 <t id="4802">The Plasma Cannon Mk 3 replaces the constant pulse of the Mk1 and Mk2 with a burst of energy that can be charged by holding the weapon trigger for a number of seconds. This makes it perfect for controlling damage to larger, slower vessels. The user is also adviced not to let the Mk3 overheat.</t>
 <t id="4901">Experimental Jump Drive</t>
 <t id="4902">Based on technology more widely available before the Jump Gate shutdown, this Jump Drive can be fitted into a small ship and be used to immediately travel to any Jump Gate or jump beacon known to the ship computer to which the Drive interfaces. The specific design of this Drive means it does not require fuel for a jump, but afterwards must be allowed to cool down before further use. However, with access to Jump Drive Coolant(see translation for 20201,16001), the cooldown process is much quicker, and the Drive can then be used immediately.</t>
 <t id="5001">Railgun Mk1</t>
 <t id="5002">Designed to release its bullet at such high speed to cause significant and almost immediate damage to its target, this particular implementation of a railgun is also equipped with an auto-zoom that allows it to focus on far-away targets when the trigger is pulled. Charging the weapon will then allow the user to specify the level of damage dealt, and only releasing the trigger will actually fire the bullet. This makes the Railgun a very effective sniper weapon.</t>
 <t id="5101">Economy Analytics Software Mk1</t>
 <t id="5102">Focused on statistical analysis, this software uses trade offers collated in the ship computer to create detailed live graphs of supply and demand over the area known to the user, as well as collating and processing data on station storage, offer amounts and offer prices. This is designed to give the user a deeper understanding of the economy and greatly improve their trading and business decisions.</t>

Due to their volatile and fickle nature, tracker mines have often caused us problems in this regard. Last time, we hired an especially eager contractor, who insisted on a 'hands on' approach. Halfway through the process, they realised their mistake and, in trying to revert the software update, accidentally reset the mines' friend-or-foe recognition. We are legally obligated to remove the malfunctioning mines and would like to outsource this task to pilots of all skill levels. If you are up for it, please also make sure not to damage our former contractor's ship, as his demise would unnecessarily strain our insurance.</t>

A military scientist, eager to research Xenon engineering, has been deployed to examine the mines and extract relevant hardware. Unfortunately in his endeavours he triggered some safeguard within the mines and activated the whole field. It's a miracle that they didn't blow him up right away, but now he is stuck and, from his position, is unable to safely attempt an escape.

They present no threat to any reasonable pilot, as they do not explode on approach, but only when ships try to depart. The locals have long-since learned to avoid them anyway. Trapped ships are charged a release fee and offered a great discount on better scanners. As it would be unreasonably expensive for me to free the trapped customers myself, I need someone to free them for a share of the fee.

 <t id="1001">Advanced Preparations</t>
 <t id="1002">We are organising an operation in which a competitor's station may find itself under significant fire, in order to make sure that they don't hold too much of an advantage over us in the market. Before that operation though, we need someone to go to the station and quietly remove some of the station defences.</t>
 <t id="1003">(Sabotage: )Station turrets</t>
 <t id="1101">Calculated Payback</t>
 <t id="1102">A former associate of mine has parted ways and decided to build a station directly competing with my own. As revenge for their little betrayal, I'd like to see them distracted by a small scare on their station; all of the defences being destroyed at once. This should be done quietly, to ensure maximum effectiveness.</t>

 <t id="1201">Art of the Illusion</t>
 <t id="1202">My associates and I are looking to make something disappear from this station, but can't make a move unless station management and local law enforcement is somewhat distracted. It shouldn't be fancy; just enough to make them look away from the right monitor for a few moments. Sabotaging station defences would do the trick nicely.</t>

 <t id="2002">Some colleagues and I are targeting a ship as the victim of our next raid. Usually we would take care of disabling the ship ourselves, but our specialist was wiped out in a planet-side speeder race.

In my personal experience, taking away her toys would most likely yield the desired results. As the commoners say, you do not realize what you have until it is gone.\n\nWARNING: Unfortunately, the sector administration might regard this as a criminal act, but you will be compensated for the inconvenience this may cause.</t>

As my assistant, you will experience first hand, a great number of interesting and peculiar scientific oddities. I long for the day that I am free to pursue these myself but alas, my current situation only allows me to watch from afar.</t>
 <t id="210">Preparation</t>
 <t id="211">To further progress in our research, we must learn more about this location. Any attempt to excite the anomaly is potentially dangerous and we must reduce that risk to an acceptable level. I have a number of suggestions that should help us understand the anomaly and its effect on nearby space.</t>
 <t id="220">The Experiment</t>
 <t id="221">I believe we are ready to move to a more active stage in our research. We will attempt to widen the anomaly to gain a clearer reading of what could be on the other side, assuming it is some for of tear through space. As with most experiments worth mentioning, this one will involve some explosives and a risk to the local environment but I have the utmost confidence that we shall achieve our goals to the highest standard.</t>

We must make haste and investigate it further before any of the locals report it to some sort of 'scientific authority'. In such an event, this mysterious structure will attract every bored charlatan scientist and our opportunity would be lost!</t>

I would like you to escort one of the ships and make sure that they do not come to any harm. I would rather my reputation not take a sizeable hit during my first moments of regained freedom.</t>
 <t id="250">Scientific Freedom</t>
 <t id="251">Now that I have once again gained my freedom, I can now put all my effort into unlocking the mysteries of this station. My initial findings point to it being some research facility, possibly Terran in origin, but with influences from several other cultures, including Boron. Whether it was a collaborative effort or through stolen technology, I can't say for sure.</t>

 <t id="2">The well known and respected Teladi Trade Guild is always looking for skilled and proven traders to bolster our ranks. You have caught our attention and we wish to extend this invitation to you. If you are interested, please meet with me.</t>

 <t id="3000">(title variants)Problematic Obstacles</t>
 <t id="3100">(briefing - section 1)</t>
 <t id="3101">The path to profit often is a treacherous one, with both natural and artificial obstacles along the way. We at the Teladi Trade Guild believe that a proactive stance is needed to both protect our assets and clients as well as discourage any heinous acts against us.</t>
 <t id="3102">Those who wish to make a profit can never help the natural and artificial obstacles that may stand in their way. That, however, does not mean that these obstacles cannot be overcome, and we believe that an active approach to dealing with these obstacles is necessary to protect both our assets and our clients.</t>
 <t id="3110">(briefing - section 2)</t>
 <t id="3111">We need a number of pilots to go out and deal with a number of potentially dangerous situations.</t>

 <t id="4102">A stagnant operation is an unprofitable one, which is why the Teladi Trade Guild is looking to expand our presence in a number of areas.</t>
 <t id="4110">(briefing - section 2)</t>
 <t id="4111">A trusted business partner is requested to help us identify such opportunities and potentially provide assets to take advantage of them.</t>

 <t id="5100">(briefing - section 1)</t>
 <t id="5101">An organisation as large and far-reaching as the Teladi Trade Guild will often run into mundane issues which limit its profitability. Should these issues never be addressed, it may well lead to financial loss. This is unspeakable.</t>
 <t id="5102">We at the Teladi Trade Guild pride ourselves on managing a vast network of traders and leading them to profit. That said, we recognise that minor issues do occur which lead to reduced profit or even a loss.</t>
 <t id="5110">(briefing - section 2)</t>
 <t id="5111">We need a resourceful pilot to look into such issues and solve them so that we can guarantee hassle-free profit for our members.</t>
 <t id="5112">An adaptable and skilled pilot is required to help us get a handle on these issues so that we can ensure continued profitability.</t>

 <t id="6101">Our influence on the market goes far beyond simply ensuring our stations remain stocked and our traders remain active. We are of course here to turn a profit and we will do so by a number of means.</t>
 <t id="6102">Running such a large and profitable organisation such as our own is a testament to our prowess in trade and management. It also highlights that our many strategies continue to work and bring in additional credits.</t>

 <t id="6111">Controlling the price of goods with supply and demand is a time-tested technique to maximise our gains in this area. We require a Teladi Trade Guild member to perform a number of tasks to help shift the market in our favor.</t>
 <t id="6112">Manipulating supply and demand to control the prices of goods works well to maximise our profits. To this end, a Teladi Trade Guild member should perform a number of tasks to help shift the market in our favour.</t>

 <t id="7100">(briefing - section 1)</t>

It is also imperative that we keep an eye on our ships to ensure their safety and that they are not taking part in nefarious acts which could lead the Guild itself into disrepute.</t>
 <t id="7102">Argon and Teladi share an old adage in that knowledge is power; in this case, the power to make a profit for one and all. In order to make the best possible business decisions, it is very important that we keep two eyes on both our competition and our own ships, as often as we can spare them, in order to ensure a broad and deep view of the current situation.</t>

 <t id="8100">(briefing - section 1)</t>
 <t id="8101">Once an intelligence network has been built, it is vital to the operation that it is maintained, so that we can always have an ear to the ground and ensure not only that our competition remains behind us, but also that our members remain out of trouble.</t>
 <t id="8102">We are keen to ensure that the vast intelligence network that we have already built is also properly maintained. This will allow us to keep an eye out for any new developments both within our own organisation and for our competition.</t>

 <t id="9100">(briefing - section 1)</t>
 <t id="9101">Some say that profit thrives in a warzone, and they are not necessarily incorrect, but there is little profit to be found for a trader that has a weapon pointed directly at them. The universe remains a dangerous place, and in order to ensure the safety of our assets and our clients, these dangers must be dealt with accordingly.</t>
 <t id="9102">Though a lot of steps have been taken since the Jump Gates began to realign to ensure a safer and more peaceful life for all, there are still many dangers across the Jump Gate network. Not only for the sake of our profit, but of course for the sake of our and our clients safety, we must make sure that we deal with these dangers.</t>
 <t id="9110">(briefing - section 2)</t>
 <t id="9111">We are looking for pilots who feel like they can tackle these dangers, should they be in the form of Xenon incursions, pirates or other, more threatening menaces.</t>
 <t id="9112">We would like someone to help us deal with these dangers, whatever they may be, without risking a loss of profit.</t>
 <t id="100001">Prospecting</t>

 <t id="6102">Sometimes in order to keep our members in business and profitable, our number-one priority at all times, it is necessary to use techniques other than keeping our members' stations in stock and giving our members suggestions on where and how to get the best deal.</t>

 <t id="6112">A commonly-used technique for ensuring long-lasting profits is to manipulate the supply and demand of goods and thus to control their prices.

 <t id="4111">With our forces being stretched we will begin a drive to shoring up our defences with the construction of defensive structures and new ships. While this is taxing on our infrastructure, it is imperative that we don't give the Xenon a free pass into our space.</t>

 <t id="5102">One of the areas that the Xenon seem drawn to are our resource fields where they often harass our mining ships. We also assume they're scouting for resources which they can use for their replication.</t>
 <t id="5110">(briefing - negative mood - section 2)</t>

 <t id="5122">The recent Xenon activity, as well as our war with the Holy Order has put a sizeable strain on our infrastructure and supply lines, leaving us with slow construction projects and the onset of rationing. As we can not allow this to continue we are requesting the willing and able pilots to help us reverse the situation.</t>
 <t id="5200">(briefing - positive mood - section 1)</t>

 <t id="6102">With the Xenon being a constant sight for such a long period of time, it has felt that we were on the back foot. However, our intelligence teams have found several targets worth engaging in the hope that it will have the Xenon pull back somewhat.</t>

We're looking for level-headed and skilled pilots, capable of doing the job and getting home safely.</t>
 <t id="6122">They may have forced our hand but the Xenon are just as vulnerable to hit-and-run tactics as anyone else. As long as those involved come back safe, we believe this is worth the effort.

 <t id="6202">We have known for some time that the Xenon might come for us again, as they have many times already. Our tactical teams are forever working to devise new ways to have the Xenon go in circles and this may just get their attention.</t>

 <t id="2">The Holy Order, an offshoot faction of the Paranid Empire, continues to test our borders and those of our allies. These 'heretics', as described by the Godrealm of the Paranid, are being pushed from all sides with no allies to speak of. We are looking for trusted friends of the Argon Federation to help keep them in check.</t>
 <t id="3">Holy Order War Room</t>
 <t id="10">(intro mission)Paranid Aggression</t>
 <t id="11">The Holy Order grows more bold and desperate with each passing day and we must show them that the Argon Federation will not tolerate any incursions into our space. We are looking for volunteers to help us enforce that stance. If you believe you have the skills and fortitude, sign up!</t>

 <t id="3101">It looks as though the Holy Order is once again preparing for a skirmish into our space, massing a number of ships on our borders.</t>
 <t id="3102">What remains of our intelligence network in Holy Order space points to them preparing forces to make another push towards our territory.</t>
 <t id="3110">(briefing - negative mood - section 2)</t>
 <t id="3111">While we continue to press the Godrealm of the Paranid to reign in their rebellion, we must remain vigilant and prepare for any outcome.</t>
 <t id="3120">(briefing - negative mood - section 3)</t>
 <t id="3121">The Holy Order believes they have the upper hand but we will be sure to have our defences ready should they try their luck. We're looking for able bodies and minds to help us in this endeavour.</t>
 <t id="3122">Time is short on us to make preparations. Defences are a priority and we're looking for independent contractors to coordinate with us in maintaining our existing countermeasures as well as deploying new ones.</t>
 <t id="3200">(briefing - positive mood - section 1)</t>
 <t id="3201">The Holy Order continues to underestimate our resolve and preparedness, as they have many times before. They are readying for a move into our space, but they will not get their wish.</t>
 <t id="3202">Our intelligence network and reconnaisance vessels confirm a build up of military assets in Holy Order space adjacent to our territory. We believe they are readying an 'invasion'.</t>
 <t id="3210">(briefing - positive mood - section 2)</t>
 <t id="3211">Should they come, we will meet them as we have before and hold this sector with ease. We must of course be cautious and ready for whatever they throw at us.</t>

 <t id="4100">(briefing - negative mood - section 1)</t>
 <t id="4101">The Holy Order once again prepare to test us. Reports talk of many combat ships, from scouts to capital-class destroyers, stocked for days of conflict, massing on our borders.</t>
 <t id="4102">We reach out again as the Holy Order prepare to test our already battered defences with newly built or prepared combat ships, armed to the teeth as always.</t>
 <t id="4110">(briefing - negative mood - section 2)</t>
 <t id="4111">Our forces are stretched to a point where we must begin driving forward with the construction of new ships and defensive structures. Our shipwrights are hard at work putting together effective and capable warships while our engineering corps continue to build and maintain our static defences.</t>
 <t id="4120">(briefing - negative mood - section 3)</t>
 <t id="4121">Any aid in these areas is much needed. We are looking for able individuals prepared to invest significant resources and effort in preparing our space for anything the Holy Order will throw at us.</t>
 <t id="4122">While we only have a short window to shore up our defences, we expect any help in these areas will play a key part in future engagements with the Holy Order.</t>
 <t id="4200">(briefing - positive mood - section 1)</t>
 <t id="4201">The Holy Order once again prepare to engage against us. They expect that we will bend and break under the force of their newly built fleets, but we know they're coming, and now we can prepare.</t>
 <t id="4202">Scouting and intelligence reports talk of Holy Order ships massing at the Jump Gates leading towards our territory. As to be expected, it looks as though it is a strong offence, but when we know it's coming, we can prepare appropriately.</t>
 <t id="4210">(briefing - positive mood - section 2)</t>
 <t id="4211">While our warships and static defences have proven themselves time and time again, we will continue to strengthen them in the face of aggression from the Holy Order.</t>

 <t id="5100">(briefing - negative mood - section 1)</t>
 <t id="5101">With reports stating that the Holy Order are building up their forces and rumours of war spreading like the plague, we have decided to take action. We assume that when the time does come, our defences will not be the only thing targeted.</t>
 <t id="5102">We stand on the brink of another conflict with the Holy Order and must take action if we are to survive yet another onslaught. When the time comes, we must make sure we are ready for the worst case scenario.</t>
 <t id="5110">(briefing - negative mood - section 2)</t>
 <t id="5111">We must be sure to safeguard the resources vital to our operations. This involves finding and protecting raw materials as well as stocking up whatever wares we are currently short on.</t>
 <t id="5120">(briefing - negative mood - section 3)</t>
 <t id="5121">The Holy Order continue to make it difficult for our freighters to do their work effectively, but with the aid of pilots like you and the rest of the Argon federal forces, we will get our infrastructure running smoothly - so we can get back to dealing with the Holy Order aggression head on.</t>
 <t id="5122">This conflict has put a sizable strain on our infrastructure and supply lines, leaving us with slow construction projects and the onset of rationing. We will not let this continue, but we require the skills of all able pilots to help us reverse the situation.</t>
 <t id="5200">(briefing - positive mood - section 1)</t>
 <t id="5201">The Holy Order will soon attempt another strike at our territories, according to all trustworthy reports. Though it has not always been the case, we must assume they have learned from prior mistakes and will target more than our defences if they wish to destroy us.</t>
 <t id="5202">Another day, another feeble attempt by the Holy Order to break our defences and our spirit. Reports indicate that they are preparing another attack, and we will be ready for them to attack not just our fleets and defences, but, desperately, our civilian structures as well.</t>
 <t id="5210">(briefing - positive mood - section 2)</t>
 <t id="5211">As we press forward against the Holy Order, we must continue to guarantee that our economy continues to function smoothly. This will include protecting our supply lines and mining areas as well as searching for any new sources of raw resources.</t>
 <t id="5220">(briefing - positive mood - section 3)</t>

 <t id="6001">Deterrence</t>
 <t id="6100">(briefing - negative mood - section 1)</t>
 <t id="6101">The intelligence network we have managed to set up in Holy Order territory has reported back that they are preparing yet another attack against us. We have decided to change our tactical response, in an attempt to change our fortune.</t>
 <t id="6102">You have no doubt heard the rumours, or seen for yourself; the Holy Order is massing combat ships on our borders. We fear another assault on our territory, soon, and wish to take them by surprise in order to get the upper hand.</t>
 <t id="6110">(briefing - negative mood - section 2)</t>
 <t id="6111">Given our position, we are looking to find and strike low risk targets in the hope that it can draw the Holy Order's attention from the fronts where our forces are stretched.</t>
 <t id="6120">(briefing - negative mood - section 3)</t>
 <t id="6121">We expect that neutralising these targets will not only destabilise the cohesion of the current enemy forces, but will also give us a decisive edge when we are ready to counter.</t>
 <t id="6122">While the Holy Order have forced our hand, we do believe that striking these targets will help turn the tide back in our favor. At the very least, it will give the Holy Order something to think about.</t>
 <t id="6200">(briefing - positive mood - section 1)</t>
 <t id="6201">Once again our intelligence network has come through for us! We now know that the Holy Order is preparing another offensive against us, and our tacticians have already started planning our counter attack. We want you to take part!</t>
 <t id="6202">We have known for some time that the Holy Order would try to push their luck, as they have many times already. Our tactical teams are forever working to find new ways to embarrass the Paranid rebels, and we are confident in this new plan.</t>
 <t id="6210">(briefing - positive mood - section 2)</t>
 <t id="6211">As we continue to strengthen our position in our space, we must prepare for the next phase of the conflict with the Holy Order.</t>
 <t id="6220">(briefing - positive mood - section 3)</t>
 <t id="6221">Before we commit a large number of our forces to the front, we first want to remove some strategic targets in order to destabilise the enemy defences.</t>

 <t id="7001">Intelligence</t>
 <t id="7100">(briefing - negative mood - section 1)</t>
 <t id="7101">While some signs point to the Holy Order planning another offensive against us, we lack the intel to be able to deploy our defences effectively.</t>
 <t id="7102">In recent weeks we have been working with nought but rumour as we try to get on top of the Holy Order's plans. We believe they are planning a new offensive.</t>
 <t id="7110">(briefing - negative mood - section 2)</t>
 <t id="7111">Intel has been a shortcoming for us so far in this conflict. We have made preparations to improve the situation but it will require skilled individuals to work alone and potentially behind enemy lines.</t>
 <t id="7120">(briefing - negative mood - section 3)</t>
 <t id="7121">What intel we do have indicates that the Holy Order continues to be overconfident and often stretch beyond their means. With improved intel, we should be able to launch strikes when they are at their most vulnerable.</t>
 <t id="7122">Our intelligence division is confident we can plug what gaps we have in our network and give us an edge on the Holy Order when we choose to strike. Of course, it will also aid us in protecting our borders against whatever they choose to throw at us.</t>
 <t id="7200">(briefing - positive mood - section 1)</t>
 <t id="7201">While we continuously push the Godrealm of the Paranid to deal with these unruly rebels, the Holy Order, we do not expect a quick solution to their conflict. This has left our intelligence community with a lot work to do in a short amount of time with limited resources.</t>
 <t id="7202">It might have been quite easy for the Holy Order to push straight through it were it not for our continuously impressive preparations; preparations we must continue to make if we wish to continue fighting the Paranid rebels. For this, we will use our greatest assets.</t>
 <t id="7210">(briefing - positive mood - section 2)</t>
 <t id="7211">Throughout this conflict, we have proven that our intelligence division is much more capable than anything the Holy Order has. In order to move forward, we must continue to press this advantage.</t>
 <t id="7220">(briefing - positive mood - section 3)</t>
 <t id="7221">We are looking for trusted individuals to put their skills to use against the Holy Order on their home turf. These tasks are not without risk but they will certainly help us maintain the upper hand.</t>

 <t id="8110">(briefing - negative mood - section 2)</t>
 <t id="8111">We have commenced operations to drive them out of our territories, but this will be a prolonged struggle.</t>
 <t id="8120">(briefing - negative mood - section 3)</t>
 <t id="8121">We need skilled pilots to aid in achieving our objectives. These will include backing up combat units when pushing the enemy back as well as holding out critical areas as we continue to rebuild our defences.</t>
 <t id="8200">(briefing - taking enemy home sectors - section 1)</t>
 <t id="8201">Thanks to the hard work of our people and allies, we find ourselves in a prime position to deal a heavy blow to the Holy Order.</t>
 <t id="8210">(briefing - positive mood - section 2)</t>

 <t id="150702">Federal Intelligence is supporting a splinter cell of the Holy Order to gather intel and disrupt the Order's administrative capabilities. Our aid consists of water transports to feed the cell's workforce. However, Intelligence recognised a small but unexpected increase in the Holy Order's population, and is now concerned about the cell's loyalty. Thus, the last deliveries have been marked with an isotope. To confirm that our federal resources are not being used against the Argon Federation, Intelligence requests scans of Holy Order ships transporting Water.</t>

While we hope to bring a number of them back into the fold, their 'governing' leaders wish them to continue down this path of blasphemy and destruction.

 <t id="5100">(briefing - negative mood - section 1)</t>
 <t id="5101">Several of our sources have reported that so-called 'Holy Order' have started resorting to lesser tactics such as pillaging freighters and sabotaging production lines.</t>
 <t id="5102">As we find ourselves facing fellow Paranid as foes, we must not underestimate their intellect, no matter how misguided they may be. Their actions have shifted to detestable tactics against a number of allied factions, including sabotage and thievery.</t>
 <t id="5110">(briefing - negative mood - section 2)</t>
 <t id="5111">It is of utmost importance that we safeguard all resources vital to our operations, especially against these despicable infidels. This will involve finding and protecting raw materials as well as ensuring that our current supplies are plentiful.</t>
 <t id="5120">(briefing - negative mood - section 3)</t>
 <t id="5121">It seems that The Order wishes to prove their path is righteous by sullying their hands. The time to see the folly of their ways will soon come, although it shall come much sooner with aid of trusted pilots such as yourself.</t>
 <t id="5122">This damnable conflict has highlighted a multitude of economic deficiencies, of which we were swift to correct. We are not blind to see that efforts from pilots such as yourself and the mighty Paranid Fleet are required to keep such a system in balance and working order.</t>
 <t id="5200">(briefing - positive mood - section 1)</t>
 <t id="5201">After the many failing of the Order, it appear that they have begun to shift to lesser tactics, attacking our freighters and sabotaging resource gathering areas.</t>
 <t id="5202">As our defences remain strong, the Order seem desperate to find a tactic to give us pause in our aggression. We have reason to believe they will target our supply lines and resources.</t>
 <t id="5210">(briefing - positive mood - section 2)</t>
 <t id="5211">We will continue to press forward against the Holy Order but we must not lose sight of our empire as a whole. We must ensure that all resources required for our efforts continue to be supplied and that our civilian crews remain safe.</t>

 <t id="6110">(briefing - negative mood - section 2)</t>
 <t id="6111">Our intelligence division has formulated a number of tactics draw the Order into a disadvantageous position. Many of the targets are classed as low-risk, to help increase the chances of success as well as allow more operations to happen concurrently.</t>
 <t id="6120">(briefing - negative mood - section 3)</t>
 <t id="6121">Neutralising these targets will not only serve to shame them, but will also give the majority of our forces a chance to focus on preparing for the next major battle. Should you wish to aid in these operations, sign up immediately.</t>

 <t id="6201">Once again, our finest minds in the intelligence division have provided us with the knowledge we need to continue to strike the Order where it greatly hurts them.</t>
 <t id="6202">As we expected, the Order remains intoxicated by pride, leading them to make rash tactical decisions. We find that it is time to make them suffer for it.</t>
 <t id="6210">(briefing - positive mood - section 2)</t>
 <t id="6211">We will strike a number of targets in their space as part of a grand strategy to draw them out of position. Their current battle plans will fall by the wayside and we will capitalise on the ensuing confusion.</t>
 <t id="6220">(briefing - positive mood - section 3)</t>

 <t id="7100">(briefing - negative mood - section 1)</t>
 <t id="7101">While we expect the zealots of the 'Holy Order' are planning an offensive against us, we currently find reliable intel not so forthcoming. As this information is valuable in formulating tactics to crush them, we must rectify this immediately.</t>
 <t id="7102">Given the recent skirmishes with the Order, it is clear that our knowledge on their fleet movements is somewhat lacking. This is clearly something we must address should we wish to regain our advantage and protect our borders.</t>
 <t id="7110">(briefing - negative mood - section 2)</t>
 <t id="7111">There are many potential avenues leading to clarity on this matter but given our resources, we must be prudent in our approach. Admitting such shortcomings is difficult for any Paranid, but given our foe, it is understandable that they can challenge our intellect, if only for a short time.</t>
 <t id="7120">(briefing - negative mood - section 3)</t>
 <t id="7121">The intel we do possess indicates that the Order is building their forces, but their target eludes us. We require pilots with a sharp mind to aid us in improving and expanding our intel gathering capabilities.</t>
 <t id="7122">Our fleet has deployed to the most likely locations that a strike may occur, but the uncertainly has already caused us to lose ground in vital areas. We seek pilots willing to delve into enemy space to help us gather further intel.</t>
 <t id="7200">(briefing - positive mood - section 1)</t>
 <t id="7201">While we have proven that our fleet is more than a match than anything the rebels of the Order can muster, we have found that the engagements we have chosen could have benefited from additional intelligence beforehand.</t>
 <t id="7202">As we push back the Order it has become clear that the current level of our intelligence gathering is sorely lacking in comparison to our allies. We must improve this situation before we find ourselves somewhat dependent on the lesser races.</t>
 <t id="7210">(briefing - positive mood - section 2)</t>
 <t id="7211">We, as Paranid, are expected to lead the way in scholastic and technological capability. We will amend the situation, but we must do so before we are prepared to deal the final blow against the heretics.</t>
 <t id="7220">(briefing - positive mood - section 3)</t>

 <t id="8110">(briefing - negative mood - section 2)</t>
 <t id="8111">Operations have commenced to drive these rebels from our space and push them to the brink. We do not expect such a fight against fellow Paranid to be settled quickly, but we will not relent.</t>

 <t id="8201">We find ourselves in the advantageous position of pushing into 'Holy Order' space at a time where they are weakened by previous engagements. We shall take this opportunity to drive them to the brink before showing them the error of their ways.</t>
 <t id="8210">(briefing - positive mood - section 2)</t>
 <t id="8211">It is clear from their lack of aggression that they neither have the zeal nor capability to call themselves the true Paranid Empire.</t>

 <t id="6102">Outside of our realm, people speak of our inevitable defeat. The Godrealm prepares once again to strike out at us in the hope that we might be crushed.

 <t id="6202">Though the watchers have been quiet as of late, it is only a matter of time before the Godrealm comes for us again. We, already prepared as we are, relish the possibility of striking first, in order to embarass the old order while it respites.</t>

 <t id="7101">Many a brave watcher has been captured or killed while operating in Godrealm space, and now we suspect they move against us again but lack the intelligence to plan against it effectively. We require new watchers to help us resolve this.</t>
 <t id="7102">The false Godrealm has actively sought to destroy our intelligence network and cripple our ability to pre-emptively plan against them. We require this intelligence network to be rebuilt so that we may know when the enemy will strike.</t>

 <t id="7111">Our still brilliant strategists have been working hard on a plan to find any kind of solution, but it will require skilled individuals who can work alone and behind enemy lines to carry it out, lest our intelligence falter and we be caught off-guard.</t>
 <t id="7120">(briefing - negative mood - section 3)</t>
 <t id="7121">From the very little we can gather, the Godrealm has grown confident and has begun to stretch their forces beyond a reasonable measure. If we can rebuild our intelligence network, perhaps we can find where they are weakest, and know exactly where to strike.</t>
 <t id="7122">Our intelligence network must be rebuilt quickly. We must know when defences are necessary and when it is wisest for us to strike. Our strategists are confident that should we manage this rebuilding, we can claw back an advantage in this ever-ongoing conflict.</t>

 <t id="7201">Behind the warships and defensive structures that keep our people safe, there are also the many brave watchers that observe the enemy from inside their own territory to report their plans and their movements. As long as there is a war to fight, these people too require our aid.</t>
 <t id="7202">The key to victory in this war against the Godrealm of the Paranid is the preparations that we are continually able to make. Such preparations would not be possible were we not to know in advance what we face, and we can only do this with the help of our intelligence network. Of course, this too needs our support.</t>
 <t id="7210">(briefing - positive mood - section 2)</t>

<page id="30230" title="Improve Station Defences" descr="0" voice="no">
 <t id="1001">Improve Station Defences</t>
 <t id="1002">After a recent review, our station defences have come under much criticism, especially given our proximity to such dangerous sectors. We have hired a specialist to help improve our existing defences as well as coordinate the deployment of new ones. We're looking for an experienced freelancer to join our team and aid the specialist in their tasks.</t>
 <t id="1003">As you probably know, I have been hired to lead the overhaul of defences at a local station. Over the years I have worked on a great many engineering projects; from destroyers to wharfs, carriers to torpedos, I've seen it all! This should be a nice change of pace, assuming we don't get a Xenon fleet making a bee-line for us. Follow my lead and we'll turn this waste of hull plating into a fortified base in no time.</t>
 <t id="1004">I don't think the manager of this station knows a spacefly from a warhead. It took me two mintues to boost the power grid in this lab by 30%. That's even 20% over the 'safety-limit', but I made it stick. Before I can even get started on the weapons, I see all sorts of improvements to be made but I'll need materials. Don't worry, I'll be sure to mark this all down in the invoice so we get reimbursed.</t>
 <t id="1005">Outrageous! The manager of this station accuses us of blowing the budget on 'trivial and dangerous tweaks'. I got so angry that I've practically lost my voice! So, this is what we're going to do. I'm going to play their game and straighten out their turret barrels, while you go out and deploy a number of defensive laser towers, the cheap kind. We'll leave this place better than we found it, split the remaining funds and move on.</t>
 <t id="1006">I'd say that's a job well done. Now, let's get out of here and get on with our lives. Best make it quick.</t>

 <t id="1001">Multi-Verse Voyage</t>
 <t id="1002">The discovery of this warp anomaly and the research that properly allows us to make use of it opens up countless literal realms of possibility. Send a ship out on a peaceful mission to explore one of these parallel universes so that we may better understand them.</t>
 <t id="1101">Venture</t>
 <t id="1102">Now that we have unlocked the path to parallel universes, we can send out scout ships to explore them. In doing so we may learn more about its inhabitants as well as what binds our universes together.</t>
 <t id="1201">Deep Space Mine</t>
 <t id="1202">There is a great deal more to be learned from rocks and gas than many would have you believe - doubly true when they come from a different universe. If we are able to learn the chemical composition of anything mining ships we send abroad bring back, it can only benefit us. Not only will they provide us with a shower of new scientific knowledge, but as long as the minerals and gases we find are close enough to what is required by refineries here, we stand to profit too.</t>
 <t id="1301">Parallel Distribution</t>
 <t id="1302">I am willing to guarantee that intelligent life will always trade, in one way or another. Whether or not we load up a transporter here and send it across a different universe to sell its wares, or send it to another universe with the order to stock up there, I would bet that a trader of any skill could bring back some currency of worth to us. Travelling from station to station or planet to planet will also give us the opportunity to map out more of these parallel universes, and may even provide some very necessary diplomatic relations.</t>
 <t id="1401">Resource Acquisition</t>
 <t id="1402">There is definitely potential to sending an empty trading ship out into the multi-verse. Risk too; we cannot guarantee that any other universe is willing to accept our currency, we cannot guarantee that our traders can bring anything back that we can sell here. However, the multi-verse is... big. Very big. I am willing to bet that somewhere out there, there is a place, person or organisation that will accept our credits in exchange for something at least close enough to one of our economy resources that it is useful. Now we just have to find them.</t>
 <t id="1501">Travelling Salesman</t>
 <t id="1502">Trading between universes is complicated. I find there to be a reasonable chance, though still small in the grand scale of things, that if we fill a transporter with resources here and send it across the multiverse, someone, somewhere will want to buy what we are selling. There is significantly less of a chance that said individual or organisation can give us something of worth in return, but in such situations we must trust in traders of all skill levels to be able to negotiate properly. What else are travelling salesmen for?</t>
 <t id="1601">Seek and Destroy</t>
 <t id="1602">We have a good understanding of how dangerous and troublesome the Xenon are, having been almost constantly reminded of the threat they pose for several centuries, at this point. It is an almost mathematical certainty that someone in another universe made the same mistake as the Terrans once did, and so I am confident that we can find Xenon in other universes than our own. Sending pilots out on patrols against them could prove good combat practice for your pilots, and is almost a diplomatic service to those inhabiting these universes.</t>
 <t id="1701">A Multiversal Problem</t>
 <t id="1702">If we can seek out a universe in which there is intelligent life and a legal system, then it is almost certain that we will find piracy too. Perhaps we can lend a helping hand here; send pilots out to patrol against these pirates - not only will it help the other universes that we come across, but is also likely to be lucrative for us. I am sure local authorities will be pleased by our work, and of course we can keep whatever we can scavenge from wrecked or abandoned pirate ships.</t>
 <t id="1801">Enemies Without Borders</t>
 <t id="1802">If so inclined, you can seek out ships belonging to multi-verse equivalents of the factions present in our version of the Jump Gate network, to... negotiate with them, aggressively. It would give your pilots combat experience, with little consequence for us here, and of course comes with the chance of salvage. Do take caution though. I'm sure that any faction you choose to measure yourself against in a parallel universe would react just as unhappily to an attack as any of ours, and of course, should anyone have developed the same technology as us, we could open ourselves to retaliation.</t>
 <t id="1901">Person of Interest</t>
 <t id="1902">With a countless number of universes at our doorstep, it is quite probable to run across someone else who has developed or discovered the same technology as us. They may be friend or foe, and will probably treat us the same way we treat them. And so, if you wish to make a name for yourself in the multi-verse, you can send ships out to target these individuals, and reap the benefits of doing so. Just bear in mind that with this technology, we may open ourselves up to counter-strike from them, and possibly their allies.</t>
 <t id="2001">Combat Encounter</t>
 <t id="2002">There are many things in this life better than conflict, but should you feel the need to train your combat pilots in an environment where they cannot possibly fall into trouble with our authorities, you can of course send them to other universes to target combat ships there instead. Naturally, this comes with its own risks; I am sure the entire multi-verse has access to equally skilled pilots, and there is a chance that one of your ships returns damaged, or does not return at all.</t>
 <t id="2101">Economic Disruption</t>
 <t id="2102">Though I don't usually condone violence, there are two advantages to targeting the transport vessels of other universes. Firstly, it disrupts economies; giving us a distinct advantage in any multiverse-wide conflict that might break out as a result of multiple universes having access to this technology. Secondly, it may give us the opportunity to study both the wares used in these universes, and the effect of cross-universe travel on these wares. If you do take this approach, do be careful however. I doubt local authorities will be too happy about this kind of behaviour.</t>
 <t id="2201">A Show of Force</t>
 <t id="2202">During my captivity, I was often told that there is no greater show of force, of how far one is willing to go, than to target civilian ships. Split are rather barbaric, but it is a good point. Unable to defend themselves, I am sure if we were to target civilians of other universes, we would eventually be able to find something of worth to bring back to our own universe. Of course, we would not be breaking any of our own laws, but I must believe that authorities in these universes would not look kindly on such an attack.</t>
 <t id="2301">Targeting the Mineral Line</t>
 <t id="2302">My mind goes once again to the inevitability of conflict between universes, should more than one unlock the secrets of this technology. If we need an advantage in such a conflict, there is none greater than targeting the mining ships that fuel their economies. This slows down the production of combat ships that can be used against us, as well as affording us the opportunity to retrieve any resources they were collecting for ourselves. Of course, this could come at a great cost for our own pilots; should they be caught I fear the consequences would be rather dire.</t>
